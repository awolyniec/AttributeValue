1	How do I install a new, non load bearing wall in my basement?	<p>I'm looking to finish my basement and simply want to wall off the concrete blocks that make up the wall. I want to insulate it as well so that it becomes a usable family room when I'm done. How do I go about installing a wall given wooden beams in the ceiling and a concrete floor?</p>
2	What kind of caulk should I use around my bathtub?	<p>I would like to recaulk between the bathtub and the ceramic-tile wall, but there are many kinds of caulking for sale.  What kind should I use?</p>
3	Is fiberglass mesh tape a good choice for drywall?	<p>I'm going to be doing some drywalling shortly and was wondering what experiences other have had with the self adhesive fiberglass mesh tape. </p>  <p>Is it a good choice or am I going to regret using it?</p>
4	Are there ways to determine if a wall is load bearing?	<p>Other than looking up blue prints, which many homeowners may not have, are there ways to determine if a wall is load bearing?</p>  <p>Methods I can think of might include:</p>  <ul> <li>Going up in the attic to check if ceiling trusses run perpendicular to the wall</li> <li>If the wall is an exterior wall</li> </ul>  <p>Any others?</p>
5	How do I safely replace a worn out electrical outlet?	<p>I have a number of outlets that are old and worn out (plugs fall out of them mainly.) Obviously I need to turn off the breaker to replace them safely but any guidance on how to rewire them, how to properly ground the new one, and how to safely test them once the power is back on is appreciated.</p>
6	How do I repair hairline cracks in stucco?	<p>The exterior walls on my house which is made of stucco, are starting to get hairline cracks in them. </p>  <p>Can anyone suggest a simple, cheap solution for it that doesn't require painting the whole house exterior?</p>
7	Where can I find a bathroom fan that will fit in a 5" cylindrical space?	<p>The fan in the master-bathroom of my house recently stopped working.</p>  <p>The old fan is in a 5" cylindrical housing in the ceiling and the housing is not going to come out without major work on the ceiling.  Unfortunately all of my local hardware stores only seem to be stocking bathroom/vent fans that fit into 6-7" square housings.</p>  <p>Does anyone know of a place where I can find a smaller size fan?  I'm open to other suggestions as well but I'd prefer to not tear the whole bathroom ceiling apart.</p>
9		<p>I've found that it works OK, but it's more difficult to get the surface smooth than paper tape -- as the mud dries, it shrinks, so the mesh starts to show through.  Obviously this is not a problem if you're going to be doing some heavy texturing afterwards.</p>
10	How do I repair a small leak in a steam radiator? Could this be a big problem?	<p>One of my steam radiators has a small leak under the bottom.  No hole is visible, but water drips out at a rate of a few drops per minute.  Various websites suggest applying a 1Â mm thick layer of <a href="http://jbweld.net/products/uses.php" rel="nofollow">J-B Weld</a> after sanding and cleaning with acetone.</p>  <p>Does the fact that the radiator leaks necessarily mean that it is completely rusted from the inside and that leaks will soon appear elsewhere?  Or is it likely that a slow leak is not due to rust, or that the rust is in only one place?</p>  <p>The radiator is decades old (perhaps even a century), but has been moved recently in order to repair the floor.  The leak is clearly away from the valve.</p>
11	How do I remove wallpaper from drywall?	<p>I know there are a lot of different ways to remove wallpaper, ranging from elbow grease to chemicals and steam machines.</p>  <p>What way(s) work(s) best?</p>
12		<p>I have used it for patching areas, but not for an entire drywall installation.  It made patching in a tight space much easier. You just needed several coats of mud on top to compensate for the shrinking.</p>
13		<p>I <em>just</em> caulked my shower last night. I used <a href="http://www.caulkyourhome.com/ge-silicone-II-kitchen-and-bath.php">GE Silicone II</a> caulk from Home Depot. I read up on this a little before picking out what kind I needed. From what I can tell, silicone caulk is good for bathrooms because:</p>  <ul> <li>It's permanently waterproof</li> <li>It doesn't crack or shrink</li> </ul>  <p>Another factor which may play into your choice of caulk could be whether or not it's paintable, but the most important factor for a bathroom is going to be waterproof/mold proof. </p>
14		<p>It's just an ornamental wall it sounds like, so do it as cheap as you can :)</p>  <p>Since you've got a beam in the ceiling, I'd just build a minimal frame out of 2x4s, nail it into the ceiling beams where you can, stick fiberglass insulation in the spaces between studs and then drywall over that.</p>
15		<p>I just bought a permanent silicone product by GE which is guaranteed to dry in 1 hour and is mold resistant. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ1xge/R-100669748/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053">GE 9.8 oz. White KB Supreme Silicone II Caulk</a></p>
16	What do I need to do to add stools to my vinyl windows?	<p>I own a "cookie cutter" house built in 2006, and all of the windows are the thin vinyl kind with no trim at all, but I like the look of having a window stool. Is there a standard practice for adding stools to this type of window? Do I need to remove the drywall on the bottom and attach the stool to the frame, or can I just place it on top of the drywall?</p>
17	How can I hanging something on an exterior wall with vinyl siding?	<p>My house has vinyl siding.  If I want to hang something on an exterior wall, can I just attach it with screws drilled through the siding?  Or do I need to do anything to prevent water from seeping in around the screws?</p>
18	How can I fill a void in a concrete seawall?	<p>My concrete seawall (on a freshwater lake) has a void in a bottom corner.  It seems to have been created with the void -- it's not a result of trapped water freezing and pushing out a chunk.  I'd like to fill the void to avoid future possible erosion.  Multiple questions:</p>  <ul> <li>Should I fill it while it's warm and underwater (summer/fall), or dry but cold (winter)?</li> <li>What should I fill it with?</li> </ul>
19	How to drain a baseboard radiator system for a repair? How to refill the system?	<p>I have a leak in the second zone in my baseboard radiator system.  When installing some drywall in the room the previous owners nicked the copper pipe with a drywall screw, and it appears to have rusted through the pipe.  I know I need to replace that section of pipe, but I can't solder the new piece in until the pipe is empty of water.</p>  <p>How can I get all the water out of the system, and when refilling, how do I fill the system back up and get any air out?</p>
20	Should old knob and tube wiring be replaced?	<p>I have been doing some electrical work in my house and I noticed it has old knob and tube wiring that is still hot, should this be replaced as found or is it fine to just leave it?  It seems really old and brittle, so I'm a little concerned.</p>
21	How do I find studs when stud finders won't work?	<p>I was trying to hang my TV at my new place, on an interior wall (between living room and a bathroom). Using the stud finder on other walls worked fine, but on this wall I got some very strange readings. An area of about 5 feet by 4 feet was setting off the AC warning, and studs seemed to be upto a foot wide and at irregular spacings.</p>  <p>I ended up drilling "exploratory holes" looking for the stud, because it didn't make sense that there would be tens of power cables in the walls, equally spread between the studs (in the air space between, and the ones attached to the studs shouldn't be within a 1/2" of the drywall. The studs turned out to be simply 2x4s with 16" centers.</p>  <p>Is there a trick I could have used rather than just drilling into the wall in exasperation?</p>
22		<p>Be sure that the leak is actually in the radiator itself, and not where the valves meet the radiator body: water is very good at travelling a good distance horizontally thanks to surface tension. I check this with a bit of paper towel.  </p>  <p>If the radiator is newly installed it may well be that the hole will sort itself out by filling with mineral deposits; if it's a hot water based system there's also proprietary sealing gunk you can add to the water that'll seal small holes.</p>  <p>If it's not new... then yes, I fear it's rusted. </p>
23	What do I have to do to prepare my garage floor for paint?	<p>I'd like to paint my garage floor, possibly with textured paint.</p>  <p>What do I have to do in order to get my garage floor, which is currently dirty and somewhat oily, ready for something like an epoxy-based, textured paint?</p>
24		<p>You should probably seal it with some kind of silicone based caulk. If water seeps in behind the vinyl you'd be inviting mold and other damage. Whenever I've attached things or drilled through my siding I've always used DAP clear silicone caulk to seal around the hole.</p>
25	What is the difference between a framing hammer and a claw hammer?	<p>What is the difference between a framing hammer and a claw hammer? Can they be used interchangeably?</p>
26	How do I remove dried paint from ceramic tiles and the bathtub?	<p>The previous owner didn't bother to lay down a dropcloth when painting the bathroom, and there are multiple, small paint stains on the ceramic tile and bathtub.  What is the best way to remove them?  </p>  <p>The only thing I can think of is to scrape it off with a razor blade, but I am afraid that it will leave scratches that are uglier than the paint stains.</p>  <p>Edit: Note that the stains are several years old.</p>
27		<p>Do you have any high powered magnets? like the rare earth neodynium magnets? If so you can probably rub one around the wall until it attaches to one of the nails in the studs. Or you can try thumping on the wall, a stud will sound alot less hollow versus empty drywall. That's how I've searched around in the past.</p>
28	How do I remove the white residue on fresh tile grout?	<p>The day after grouting my tile, a white residue formed on top of the (grey) grout.  Moistening the grout makes the residue go away until it dries again.  I've been told the problem is because I had too much water in my grout mixture when I applied the grout, but how can I get rid of this residue?</p>
29		<p>If you plan on doing much electrical work around the house, get a multi-meter. It's just a little box with black and red probes on the end. Safe enough to stick in an outlet to see if it's live or not.</p>  <p>Outlets are mostly idiot proof. Turn off the breaker, pull it out of the box, see where the old wires are attached and move them one by one to the new outlet. Probably the old outlet already has a ground wire, in which case you're done. If it doesn't, it's probably time to call a pro.</p>  <p>Once you have it hooked up and the power is back on, you can use the multimeter to test. There is a hot side and a neutral side to the outlet. Ground behaves the same as neutral as far as the multimeter is concerned. You should be able to stick one prob in the hot side and the other into ground or neutral and get around 110 on the multimeter (+/- 2-3 volts).</p>
30	Why does my toilet's seal wear out so fast?	<p>The toilet in our only bathroom seems to go through drain seal about once a year.  The flange on the drain line is old, and broken in several places, but we're able to keep everything firmly in-place none-the-less.  We've tried both regular wax seals, and ones with reinforcing, both of which seem to fail much faster than designed.</p>  <p>Are there any good tips/tricks to getting the seal to last longer (more like the 10 years others get)?</p>
31	What are my options for asphalt driveway repair and/or sealing?	<p>I live in New England and my asphalt driveway is showing a lot of cracks.  There's also a little divot in one flat spot that collects water.</p>  <p>What are my options for getting the driveway back to looking good, and stopping any further damage?</p>
32		<p>One way I would try is an "educated guess exploratory hole method." Try locating a stud with a stud finder on the same wall, but away from the problem area. Then, if you have a little bit of faith that your builder followed the standard 16" stud spacing, measure over and drill at 16" intervals.</p>
33		<p>I've used mineral spirits to remove everything from paint to roofing tar. Takes a bit of rubbing to do it but it usually pulls it off. I'd recommend trying it on an inconspicuous area first to make sure it doesn't do any damage, mineral spirits is powerful stuff.</p>
34		<p>It depends :)</p>  <p>It really depends on how old the wallpaper is, if there are multiple wallpapers glued over each other and how much glue was used.</p>  <p>If the wallpaper is not too old, and was put on in a proper way, usually, a steamer works very well. It has the advantage that it loosens the glue without making the wallpaper to fragile to pull it off. </p>  <p>I usually try to stay away from chemicals, because they always have some danger for health associated.</p>
35	Is there a trick to applying caulk using a caulk-gun?	<p>Perhaps it is just me, but no matter how careful I try to be, any attempt to apply caulk or cement or anything with a caulking gun into a crack results in total mess.</p>  <p>The main problems that seem to be causing this are: </p>  <p>1: The caulk doesn't "stick down" so as I pull the gun over the crack it drags the tendril of caulk along with it.</p>  <p>2: As demonstrated on every home improvement show, I run my finger along the caulk line to press it down into the crack, but it inevitably squishes out on the tile or sticks to my finger and makes a big mess.</p>  <p>Is there some trick that I just don't know that makes a good clean caulk line?</p>
36	How can I paint over a ceiling after there's been a leak?	<p>We had a leak in our upstairs bathroom, about 2 weeks after we had a new ceiling put up and painted in the room below. It wasn't a major leak, but it caused quite a wide line to show up on the ceiling.</p>  <p>I've painted over the line 3 times now, but it just keeps reappearing, is there anything I can do to stop the water mark from showing up?</p>
37		<p>The siding needs to remain free to expand and contract.  So cutting at least a slot , then hanging something through that would work, but would be unsightly, and would leak water through the hole.  So I think that finding some kind of gasket or trim piece (such as is found where your vents protrude through siding) and trimming with J-channel all around it would look better and would be less prone to leaks.</p>
38		<p>You shouldn't have to do anything too special, but here are a few tips from my experience:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Use a treated board for the bottom of the wall where it touches the concrete.  This will help to prevent rotting from any moisture that may seep up from the concreate.</p></li> <li><p>Build the whole wall on the ground just a bit shorter than the lowest joist/beam so you can easily raise it into place without it getting stuck.</p></li> <li><p>At the bottom secure it with cement nails/ramset/tapcon screws to the cement floor.  </p></li> <li><p>At the top, if the wall is perpendicular to the joists, you can shim between the bottom of the beams and the top of the wall and nail through those to attach it to the joists/beams.  </p></li> <li><p>If the wall runs parallel to the beams/joists you can either put scraps between the beams and nail to those or you can attach a scrap of 2x4 flatwise to the wall and up against a stud, attach it to the cement wall, then nail through the stud and into the side of the scrap.  Do that for every other stud or so.</p></li> </ol>
39	What are my lighting options for a pole-barn garage?	<p>I just added on to my pole-barn garage, it now has 1500 square feet. There is a single flourecent (and door opener) lighting it currently. I would like to add some serious lighting as I work on my cars, and do woodworking in there, unlike the previous owner. </p>  <p>The ceiling height goes from 12-16', is this too short for high bay lighting?</p>  <p>Is there something more economical than high-bay?</p>
40		<p>Use two of the wax seals stacked on top of one another. It takes more squishing to set the toilet down, but the seal is a lot more resilient to shifting.</p>  <p>My plumber gave me this tip, and it seems to have worked the two times I used it.</p>
41		<p>I purchased a garage floor epoxy kit It contained very detailed instructions on how to prep the floor. It also had muriatic acid in it to etch the floor before painting on the epoxy.  </p>  <p>One tip I would give is to have someone help you put it on.  You only have a limited time to work with the epoxy once the two parts are mixed. If you have one person cutting in and one person rolling on the main part, it is much easier to get it done in the setup time of the epoxy.</p>
42	What is a good method to seal a baseboard to stop an existing draft?	<p>Probably, due to faulty insulation/damp barrier, there is a cold draft coming through one of the upstairs baseboard. What is a good method to seal it? (It is a rented house, so, no I do not want to fix the source of the problem)</p>
43		<p>Something like <a href="http://www.toolup.com/sperry_gfi6302_gfci-outlet-tester.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> (not <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/lebedev.shtml" rel="nofollow">this</a>) should show you quickly if your current plugs are wired correctly, and should also test the ground. If you've got a good ground, then replacing the socket should be just a matter of:</p>  <ul> <li>Turning off the breaker</li> <li>Unscrew and disconnect the socket</li> <li>Re-strip the ends of the wires if needed</li> <li>Attach the new socket to the same three wires</li> <li>Screw the new socket in</li> <li>Turn on the breaker</li> <li>Test the socket with your fancy tester</li> </ul>  <p>If you don't have good ground, then you might not have a ground wire running into the box, which makes this alot harder, and you might want to call a real electrician at that point.</p>
44		<p>The methods you describe are probably the best, but if you can actually see the wall, a load bearing wall will generally have a double top plate but a non-load bearing wall usually won't.</p>
45		<p>A variation to the "educated guess exploratory hole method" is to use a small finish nail (longer than the drywall thinkness) and "explore" by nailing that in near the floor boads.  If it moves free after hitting it in, you are not in the stud, move 1.5" to the left or right and try again.  After you find the stuf, use a level or plumb bob to trace up the wall.  The holes will be so small and near the floor so you can easily patch or paint over then.  </p>  <p>I have also removed the baseboard in the past and put the nails in there, that way the holes would be covered when you put the baseboard back on.</p>  <p>Scott mentioned magnets, I have also used a stud finding magnet, that you run all over the wall and it will find the screws / nails that the drywallers used.  These nails / screws will be over a stud.</p>
46		<p>A straight razor blade shouldn't cause any trouble on your ceramic tile (assuming it has a smooth finish) or an enameled tub, but a fiberglass tub you're right to worry about.</p>  <p>Depending on the number of stains you're trying to remove you may find that heating the surface a bit by filling the tub with hot water then draining again will weaken their hold on the tub enough that you may be able to remove them with gentle scraping with a putty knife (being careful not to dig into the tub's surface).</p>
47		<p>First of all, buy a good drip free caulking gun. Make sure you cut the tip of the caulk on an angle.  If you want a perfectly straight line on each side, put painters tape on each side of the area you want to caulk.  Then just pull it up before the caulk dries.</p>  <p>If you do not want to use your finger to smooth it, the little squeegie like tools that you can get at hardware stores work well.  Another option is to use the plastic credit card samples you get in the mail when they want you to apply for a new credit card.</p>
48	How can I repair a Palruf roof?	<p>I've installed a couple of transparent <a href="http://www.palramamericas.com/palrufline" rel="nofollow">Palruf</a> PVC sheets for a treehouse roof. I've gotten some small (several inch) holes in it that I'd like to patch up. I have some small pieces of Palruf left over that I was contemplating using to patch up the existing roof.</p>  <p>Any thoughts on adhesives or techniques for this, or better approaches? This is a treehouse, but I'd like to keep the rain from pouring in.</p>
49		<p>I read on several DIY websites that recommended taping blue painter's tape the width of the bead you want to lay down. I tried it last night on my shower, and it worked fairly well. Here's what I did:</p>  <ol> <li>Clean and dry area to be caulked</li> <li>Put tape on both sides of joint</li> <li>Caulk (my initial pass looked pretty messy)</li> <li>Use your finger or a caulk smoothing tool to get rid of excess</li> <li><strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> remove painter's tape by pulling away from the joint at a 45 degree angle</li> </ol>  <p>At this point, I noticed that there was a slight ridge from where the tape pulled out from behind the bead. If it's really bad, then re-smooth the joint.</p>  <p>PS: I just used a cheap $5 caulk gun I picked up at Home Depot</p>
50		<p>Stains will usually come right through a new coat of paint.  </p>  <p>Did you prime it first?  In my experience I've found that a good oil (or even better, shellac) based primer works best for keeping stains from bleeding through the paint.</p>
51		<p>Leave it to dry <em>thoroughly</em>. This might take several weeks, I'm afraid.</p>  <p>Once dry, try an exterior-grade primer before two or three more coats of paint. </p>
52		<p>For many houses, a wall running down the middle of the house, parallel with the roof ridgeline is nearly always load bearing. You also may have easier access to the basement to check joist direction.</p>
53	What are the tools that every Do-it-Yourselfer must own?	<p>What are the tools that every DIY'er should have? This is a community wiki as there is no one right answer.</p>  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong>  </p>  <ul> <li>One item per answer (so they can be voted on - answers with multiple items will be voted down)</li> <li>Clear formatting like this:<br> <strong>[ITEM NAME]</strong><br> [Reason why item is essential/useful/good]<br> [Photo / other info]</li> </ul>
54		<p><strong>A cordless drill</strong><br> No doubt about it. I bought a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000X1PZVK">DeWalt 14.4V</a> three years ago, and it's been invaluable to me. <img src="http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/34/34c4b1f5-f4c7-465c-b9bb-f0a9ba2cd2ef_300.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
55		<p>I personally find a Mark One Digital Manipulator does the job! Seriously: use your fingernail.</p>  <p>Alternatively, choose an appropriately hard scraper of some kind. A razor blade should be fine on good-quality gloss-finish ceramic tile, but I'd use a hard plastic knife of some kind on a plastic tub.</p>
56	Does liquid aerification work?	<p>I have terrible soil in my yard, because the builder scraped off most of the topsoil and sold it.  I need to aerate the yard and get some more nutrients in it.  Has anyone tried any  of the liquid aerification products?  I tried Aerify Plus, but it hasn't been long enough to judge if it is helping.</p>
57		<p>Yes definitely. In some spots, knob and tube is a deal breaker for a house sale and must be replaced before the house is sold. It's fairly dangerous to have around, even more so if it's brittle. I'd hire an electrician if you're not comfortable replacing it all yourself.</p>
58		<p>I'd probably try for a mix of natural light, fluorescent, and point lights.</p>  <p>The natural light will be the most economical, but obviously fails at night.</p>  <p>The fluorescent lighting should give you enough light for most working conditions.</p>  <p>And the point lights should help for when you need to do detail work or get under the hood of your cars. You can find point lights on articulated arms, that way you can just grab and move the light to wherever you need it. Mounting an arm or two on each pole would probably be enough.</p>
59		<p>There may be issues with your insurance company.  I recently bought a house and asked two insurance companies about the knob-and-tube wiring.</p>  <ul> <li><p>Liberty Mutual said that they would insure the house, but would require that the knob-and-tube wiring be removed within 30 days by an electrician.</p></li> <li><p>Met Life said that they would not be able to insure the house until the knob-and-tube wiring had been removed.</p></li> </ul>
60		<p>The advice my family once got from an electrician on this question was that if you have low amperage service and NEVER touch it, you're probably okay.  If you have regular electrical service or touch the circuits at all, remove ALL of it. His basic theory was that if you keep the wires cool, and they haven't caused you trouble yet, it's unlikely to cause a problem. Granted that advice was about 15 years ago and none of that wiring is improving with age.</p>  <p>Once you touch the lines at all, rip it all out.  It's very likely that you will introduce a problem between the coating and the wire. The house we were dealing with went another 10 years before we needed to rewire one of the old circuits.  Once that happened we rewired the entire house all at once.</p>  <p><strong>If you're concerned at all, turn off the affected circuits, and get rid of it</strong>. Better safe than sorry on this one.</p>
61	Which water heater types do you recommend?	<p>I would like to upgrade my current water heater with one that</p>  <ul> <li>Is able to produce/store more heated water so I won't run out</li> <li>Energy efficient</li> <li>Inexpensive</li> </ul>  <p>What are the advantages/disadvantages to each different kind? What would you recommend and why?</p>
62		<p><strong>A circular saw</strong> of course.  </p>  <p>And don't skimp - you'll use it enough that it's worthwhile to spend the money and get a decent (and light) one.</p>
63		<p>Generally, it is a good idea to replace it, especially if you can easily access it. One thing you <em>don't</em> want to do, is replace part of a circuit. Then the next guy might see the new romex and make some assumptions about the rest of the wiring. The other time you really really should replace it is if it runs through insulation, especially blown-in cellulose. That is a serious fire hazard. Knob and tube was designed to use open space as an insulator.</p>
64		<p>Spray foam maybe? They sell it at local stores here, I believe it's called "Great Stuff". You spray it in cracks and it expands to fill the gap.</p>
65	How can I pour a concrete pad with a circular hole in it?	<p>Essentially, I'd like to put down a concrete pad for a patio, but leave a couple of circular areas within that patio unpaved (for planting shrubs).</p>  <p>I'm familiar with the techniques for using dimensional lumber for angular concrete pads, and even using plywood for curved ones, but is there a clever trick or something for creating say a 3' diameter unpaved area within a concrete pad aside from trying to bend plywood planks into a circle?</p>
66	How do I sound-proof a bathroom?	<p>I think most people would agree that sound proofing a bathroom is a swell idea. Since bathrooms are special rooms (high humidity), what are some tips and techniques you can use to sound proof one without running into water/mold problems down the line?</p>  <p>I am asking in the context of a bathroom in the process of being remodeled. This allows major "design" changes but probably not significant structural changes.</p>
67	Should I use a subfloor for a finished basement's floor?	<p>We are refinishing our basement and have not yet decided what to do for the floors.  Part of the basement will be tile, and we are all set.  However, the rec room side is going to be carpet.  The basement is dry, and we have never had any water or moisture issues.</p>  <p>Some research has said to simply lay carpet like normal, with a thinker pad on the concrete.  While OK, I am worried a little about the coldness, a vapor barrier, and the comfort level (too hard on concrete).  One carpet guys said they make special pads that are vapor or moisture proof and will not have mold issues and are made for concrete floors.  </p>  <p>Other people has said to lay .5"-1" foam board down, and then install plywood on top of that.  That would help to insulate, make it feel like a normal floor, and provide a good moisture barrier)  But this would cost more in labor and materials, and cut into the height of the room (it is 7'8").  And although we have not had water issues, heaven forbid if we did, this would be a major pain to rip it out.</p>  <p>What has everyone else done?  Any recommendations?</p>
68	How can I remove rust stains from enamel sink?	<p>Is there a sure-fire way to get rust stains off of an enamel sink? </p>

71		<p>A steamer is by far the best option: I've had great success even with multiple layers of woodchip. (Ugh!)</p>  <p>It can definitely help to rough the surface of the paper before steaming, especially if it's been painted. </p>  <p>If it's a real mess then it is actually feasible to plaster over paper, but I'd personally not recommend that approach unless you know a good plasterer or can do it yourself easily. </p>

75		<p>I have a tankless heater, and I love it for the efficiency (energy and space wise) and of course the endless hot water.  But there are some drawbacks:</p>  <ol> <li><p>There is a minimum flow rate required for it to "fire up".  That flow rate is high enough that you won't get hot water out of a faucet unless it's turned all the way over to "hot" and on full blast.  In general, getting hot/warm water out of faucets is just a pain in the butt.  This may be solved with newer models, but something to look out for.</p></li> <li><p>There is a limited flow rate.  So, if you're taking a nice hot shower and the washing machine kicks on, you could be in for a blast of cold water and a sudden drop in water pressure.  Make sure the unit is sized appropriately for the number of hot-water using items you plan to use at any given time.</p></li> </ol>
76		<p>It sounds to me like the area you are caulking is not clean. Especially for tile, you need to make sure to really clean the area you will be caulking, as dust and soap scum will make it tough for the caulk to stick. Also, make sure you are using the correct kind of caulk for the job.</p>

81	What is the best way to adjust pocket doors stuck on carpet?	<p>We had new carpet installed with a thicker pad.  Now the pocket doors stick on the carpet.  What is the best way to get at them to adjust them?  The best options I have come up with is to remove the trim (which I do not want to do) or cut a hole in the drywall and repair it (which I may do).</p>
82		<p>To prevent the messiness when smoothing it out with your finger, have a moist sponge handy.  Smooth out a couple feet of calk, then wipe your finger on the sponge to get the excess caulk off and keep your finger moist.</p>
83		<p>My wife and I just renovated a house that had 5 layers of wallpaper in the living room (including the "Hay" wallpaper from circa 1985) and we bought two steamers and went to town. It was the best solution we found. You don't have to spend a lot, just get the inexpensive plastic steamer unless you plan on doing it for a living.</p>  <p>She did re-use the steamers several more times for her painting business and they still work well.</p>  <p>Matt</p>

88	How to have a free-standing bathtub resurfaced	<p>I have a nice free-standing claw-foot tub.  It was re-finished poorly by a previous homeowner and now we're getting white flakes in the water.  There are also rust spots in a couple of places.  </p>  <p>There seem to be several techniques for refinishing tubs but I'd like to do it right.  What should I be looking for as I shop for contractors to do the job?  What questions do I need to be asking?</p>

91		<p>Note that, at least currently, tankless water heaters don't always pay for themselves in some parts of the country. Here in New England, the cold water temperature is too cold to make them worth it, though this should change soon. It also depends on if you have a gas or electric model (for both tank and tankless, gas is cheaper). Given the speed that tankless heaters have been improving, I am planning on waiting another 5 years or so, especially since I just replaced my old tank 6 months ago.</p>
92	I added insulation to my attic rafters, but should I have left room for airflow?	<p>I added insulation to my attic rafters and plugged the space between the outdoors and my attic with insulation.  It lowered my heating bill by $150/month, but I've seen some information that I may have made a mistake by cutting off the airflow in my attic.  </p>  <p>Did I make a mistake, and if so, how can I properly insulate my attic?  There's already insulation in the floor.</p>
93		<p>Try careful knocking while listening with a stetoscope.  Knocks on the studs will sound less hollow.</p>

95	What is an Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter?	<p>What is an Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) and where should they be used?</p>
96		<p>If the gap isn't too big, regular caulk will seal the gap between it and the wall.  If you're using it at the top of the baseboard and can get it in the same color as the baseboard, you might not even have to paint it.</p>
97		<p>In my experience, framing hammers are generally larger and heavier, have a straighter "claw" and are more suited to the demands of framing. They provide less accuracy but more force, which is nice. And the straighter claw is good for prying boards apart. If you only have one hammer, you want a claw, but if you are doing a lot of framing, a framing hammer is a nice addition.</p>
98		<p>One very important thing that others have not mentioned - If the outlet is in a kitchen in an older home, it will often have separate circuits for the top and bottom plug.  </p>  <p>So, if that's the case, make sure BOTH circuits are off, and when you put the new outlet in, make sure you break off the little tab that connects the top and bottom wire connectors on both sides of the outlet (note that you ONLY do this if there are two circuits on the outlet.  Leave the tab on if there's only one)</p>
99	How can I stop new solid oak floor from squeaking?	<p>really hope someone here can come up with an idea to get me out of this one:</p>  <p>I recently laid a new floor in my dining room, it's solid oak and it actually looks quite good considering I put it down!</p>  <p>Only problem is, it's quite creaky when you walk on it. </p>  <p>I asked a few friends (one contractor builder, the rest just amateur DIY'ers like me) about the best way to lay it, and they all said to install it as a "floating" floor. So I went out and bought a load of fixing clips, and as I went along, I put one clip about every 3 foot from each other between each strip of flooring.</p>  <p>Now I'm not so sure if that was needed, as I was laying it onto existing floorboards. </p>  <p>I'm pretty sure it's the fixing clips which are causing the floor to creak, but I don't think I'm going to be able to lift it all up (without damaging it all), as the clips are holding it all together pretty tight. Any ideas on how I can stop the creaking?</p>
100		<p>Framing hammers typically have heavier heads and longer handles, and the face is usually not flat (I think the claw is less curved as well).</p>
101		<p>The point of allowing airflow to reach the outside is so hot air can escape. If it doesn't escape then it will heat up the roof/rafters and cause snow to melt and then turn to ice. This can damage your roof in a number of ways. Also, moisture will be trapped in the attic and can cause mold or damage to the structure.</p>  <p>I believe the optimum way to insulate your attic is to insulate the floor of the attic very well but allow the air above that to escape (ie. insulate the ceiling of the attic poorly)</p>
102		<p>I've found that if you push the tip of the caulk gun forward along the line rather than drag it behind you can often make a very neat bead of caulk that needs little or no smoothing afterwards.</p>
103		<p>I've found you don't need a steamer or special chemicals.  If you do use a steamer, be really careful not to damage the wall.  Plaster will break apart, for example.</p>  <p>Instead, I've used one of those wallpaper scoring tools to cut small holes in the surface.  Then, apply hot water from a spray bottle liberally over the paper and let sit for 30 minutes or so.  It should then start peeling away easily with a scraper.  Of course this depends on the type of glue used.  If this doesn't cut it, you may need to mix some kind of glue solvent in the sprayer.  This process worked on a circa 1950's house on plaster walls.</p>
104	How do I make a lamp cord stick to drywall?	<p>Because trying to fish electrical wire through the walls and ceilings of my old house was too daunting, I have resorted to using a lamp cord to power a ceiling-mounted light from an existing outlet on the wall.  How do I make the cord stick to the drywall?</p>  <p>I tried hot glue, but it didn't hold.  And cable clips (white plastic loops with nails) fell right out of the drywall.</p>
105		<p>You don't want to plug the space between the outdoors and the attic.  As Joe mentioned, that will cut off airflow in the attic and cause ice dams in the winter.  It will also keep your attic VERY hot in the summer, and raise your AC costs.</p>  <p>Ideally you want a "cold" attic - lots of insulation between the ceiling and the attic, and no insulation between the attic and the roof, along with plenty of soffit and ridge vents to keep the air circulating up there.</p>
106		<p>Don't - they make special conduit just for that.  You can pick it up at Home Depot/Lowes/etc.</p>
107		<p>You can buy air ducts that staple to the inside of your roof above the eave vents and fit between the rafters.  The will hold open an air gap of approximately 1 inch to allow airflow past a layer of insulation.  The ones I've used are made of styrofoam and IIRC they cost around $2.  You should be able to find them near the insulation in your home improvement store.</p>  <p>EDIT: They are called baffles or <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=diy.diy_rafter_vents" rel="nofollow">rafter vents</a>; this is how they're installed:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZG5Df.jpg" alt="metal rafter vent between wooden roof and insulation"></p>
108	How do you descale a dishwasher heating element?	<p>I've tried something I got at Lowes (with the wax plug, you put upside down) and CLR.</p>  <p>The CLR worked the best, but didn't really get it off and it's building up again.</p>  <p>I've heard vinegar will work if you use it regularly.</p>
109	Where should I start tiling my bathroom wall?	<p>The bathroom I'm about to tile has a complex layout, and I've never put tile on a wall before.  Let me see if I can paint a verbal picture...</p>  <p>The room is approx. 6'("short side") by 10'("long side").  The short side has the door on one end, and a window centered above the tub on the far end.  The window is about 3' above the tub and (used to be) a typical household window.  The tub stretches from one side of the room to the other.  Toilet and sink are along the long side.</p>  <p>The tile would extend from the door jamb about 5' from the floor, over the tub where it goes up to near the celing, around the back wall over the window, then back down again and across behind the toilet and sink.</p>  <p>So I have a couple features that influence, I believe, where I start tiling--the window and the tub.</p>  <p>I believe I should start at the window and tile outward, which ensures the tile is centered on that spot.  However I'll probably end up with oddly cut tiles at every single corner in the bathroom.</p>  <p>Another option is to start centered directly above the tub.  That way the tile grows up with regular sized tiles until the window, which would end up with oddly cut tile around it.</p>  <p>I'm afraid that when I get down to the nasty business I'll end up picking the wrong way, and every time I go in the damned bathroom I'll look at it and obsess about my decision.</p>  <p>Which is it--window outwards, or tub upwards?  Or is there even a third option I should pick?</p>
110		<p>An arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) contains electronics that detect sudden bursts of current, faster than a circuit breaker would trip.  This is intended to prevent fire from arcs.</p>  <p>An arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) is different from the more common ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI).</p>
111		<p>Metal landscape edging (the kind that's held in with stakes) should work fairly well. You could either just leave it there or cover it in plastic and remove it after the concrete sets (personally, I'd leave it).</p>
112		<p>I like it since it generally goes on quite a bit faster.  The only place I don't like it is for inside corners.  It's much easier to get a nice clean corner with paper tape since it has that convenient seam down the middle for folding it.</p>
113		<p><strong>Screwdriver set</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/7803/31032044.jpg" alt="screwdrivers"></p>  <p>Your exact types will differ by country, but you likely want:</p>  <ul> <li>Slot-head (2 or 3 sizes)</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips">Phillips</a> (atleast size #3, maybe #2 and #4)</li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Robertson">Robertson</a> (atleast red, green, and black)</li> </ul>  <p>Rubber handles will save your hands after a bit of use. Also, try to find black tipped drivers, as this means they're hardened and shouldn't wear down as quickly.</p>
114		<p>There are many sizes of conduit (also known as trunking) available that should do the job. Some are even self-adhesive.</p>  <p>Alternatively it is possible to replace the nails on cable clips with screws and drill/plug those into drywall, but the result is very ugly.</p>  <p>Also, consider that the lamp cord need not take the most direct route. Most old houses have wires that go in very strange directions: I've seen some go up into the ceiling, along to a cupboard, down two floors, then back up a floor to the lightswitch! </p>
115	How well do metal inside corner beads work?	<p>I'm currently doing some drywalling in my basement, and the biggest PITA for me is always finishing the inside corners.</p>  <p>Recently I saw at Home Depot they have these metal inside corner bead pieces.  They pretty much look just like an outside corner bead, but smooth and with paper tape around the edges.  </p>  <p>They certainly look like they would make things a lot easier, but does anyone have any experience with using those?</p>
119		<p>Pocket doors can usually be adjusted by turning/twisting an adjustment screw at the top (sometimes a wheel at the bottom depending on the door). The door should allow for this adjustment somewhere without removing anything.</p>
121	What's a good way to anchor the central bolts of a pair of gates?	<p>So I've a pair of new handsome wrought-iron gates for the bottom of my (tarmac) drive. The gates each have a long thin "bolt" that is intended to go into a hole in the drive itself.</p>  <p>My initial feeling is that a couple of short lengths of metal tube set into concrete should hold them nicely. But, I'm concerned they'll soon fill with mud or earth or leaves and turn into a maintenance headache.</p>  <p>Any guidance? Should the tube be long (in which case I'll need a deep hole) or short (but this might fill up faster?) Would a bit of old copper tube I've got about the place do the job?</p>
122		<p>Rubber mallet - good for things where a hammer will just dent things - also good for adjusting things with taps.</p>
123		<p>A house in San Carlos CA, Having 50% knob-and-tube, 50% 1980 romex:</p>  <p><strong>Insurance was no problem</strong>: No company cared (I ended up getting it from Travelers, via GEICO). So, I wouldn't let the insurance stories scare you until you pick up the phone and ask. What they <strong>do</strong> care about is the type of Circuit breakers you have. The modern ones that look like switches, or the old wire ones (that burn). That may be an issue if you have the old plugs.</p>  <p><strong>knob-and-tube has 2 disadvantages:</strong></p>  <ol> <li>Theoretical fire hazard: you see, they need to be able to "breathe". That is why they say that it is a problem to insulate over K&amp;T. And why everyone will say, that if "you touch it" you may disturb it and hence you should remove it. </li> <li>They have no grounding. So that "3rd" leg some appliances may have even if your socket accepts it, will do nothing. That is a higher risk of getting an electric shock. </li> </ol>  <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> It might be a problem with putting things "on paper" vs. verbally, but I interviewed many electricians and 3 permit employees (since I was remodeling the kitchen and "touched' some of the old K&amp;T). My experience is that most of them, when not motivated to just make money out of you, say that K&amp;T is just fine, there are <em>plenty</em> of old houses with it and you don't really see houses go up in flames around you do you? and when fire happens on the news, when did you hear that it was blamed on old K&amp;T system (most likely you hear it was a heater or candles)</p>  <p><strong>my</strong> personal comclusion, if it is not broken, don't fix it. do it only if you are doing some other thing which justifies the work. </p>  <ul> <li>Expect $3,000 to $10,000 to re-wire the house or portion of it (I only needed 50%, and I had some walls and ceiling open anyway)</li> <li>notice that some electricians put in the quoted work the electric work, but you will have some cleanup work of patching walls and painting after they are done</li> </ul>  <p>Expect anything from  $3000 to $10,000.</p>
124		<p>I would use a sound proofing insulation in the walls, then instead of using normal drywall, use a moisture resistant or mold resistant type.  Thicker drywall will also help with sound deadening. </p>  <p>At last resort, put in a super loud ceiling fan that turns on with the light, that way even if it'll cover up the sound of you peeing. :)  </p>
126		<p>If it were my house I'd get painting! Paint is intended to seal hairline cracks of this kind. Depending on your locality you may find that it's feasible to spray a paint finish over stucco, which can be by far the easiest and cheapest way to do it. </p>
127		<p>Best thing you can do is ask for references.  Call some people who had their tub refinished several years ago and see how it's holding up.</p>  <p>I've had this done a few times and it's a bit of a black art.  They have to be really meticulous with their prep work or the new finish won't last.</p>  <p>Also, you need to be careful what you clean it with after they refinish it!  Abrasive cleaners will destroy the finish.</p>
128	What is the best method to patch a large hole (2-3 inches) in drywall?	<p>I have a large hole where a TV wall mount once was (I believe the hole was used to run power and coax cable to the TV). I have since moved the TV and would like to patch the hole. What is the best way to do this?</p>
129		<p>They sell dry-wall patches for this purpose.</p>
132	What can be done to fix a squeak in stairs?	<p>This might be better suited as a community wiki, what do you think?</p>  <p>My parents house has very squeaky stairs. The house is over 100 years old, so it's to be expected. What can be done to fix a squeak in stairs, and prevent new ones from cropping up?</p>
133		<p>Correct way to do it as instructed on 'Canada's worst Handyman':</p>  <ul> <li>cut a piece of strapping (wood) that will be a couple inches longer than the hole on each side.</li> <li>put the strapping inside the hole and attach it using a couple of drywall screws so that it is across the hole. </li> <li>cut a piece of drywall that is the same size as the hole, as close as you can get</li> <li>attach the patch to the strapping with a drywall screw</li> <li>mud, sand, paint. </li> </ul>  <p>Same process works for larger holes and also on the ceiling which can be tricky.</p>
134		<p>Use a drywall repair patch. They are cheap and easy to find at the big box stores.</p>  <p>And here's a video on how to do it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvtoikKG318" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvtoikKG318</a></p>
135		<p>The squeak is typically caused by a joint between two pieces of wood having worked loose over the years. </p>  <p>Personally I'd leave it alone; if you don't want squeaks, move to a new house! </p>  <p>But seriously: you may find that working small fine fillets of wood between the joints that are creaky may provide temporary relief. I'd not want to go so far as screwing the joints together or (yuck!) glueing them, as while this will solve the problem it's a very destructive thing to do to old woodwork.</p>
136		<p>Stairs squeak because the stair board is not staying flush with the board underneath and the movement creates the squeaking noise.</p>  <p>In order to remove this, you must find the place the moves and nail or screw it tight to the underlying board. This will remove any squeaking noises.</p>
137	How do I add an exhaust fan to an old attic?	<p>Our house's attic retains a great deal of heat during summer.  While we now have a good layer of insulation between the attic and the rest of the house I wonder if it would be worth it to add some kind of exhaust fan.  We live in a mid-Atlantic state so we have to contend with both 100&deg;F summer days and 0&deg;F winter nights.</p>  <p>The house still has the original slate roof so adding a typical roof-based system isn't an option.  There are three small circular windows that provide some air flow, but not much.  My thought was to install a fan in one of those windows to force a cross breeze during warm days.</p>  <p>Is this likely to save us any energy (given that the fan will have to draw some power)? Are there options for solar-powered small window exhaust fans out there?</p>
138	Can I sand bamboo floors?	<p>I have prefinished bamboo floors in the kitchen and they are not in a good shape. I was wondering if i can sand them. Somebody told me that i can't send prefinished floors (oak or bamboo), somebody else said i can. </p>
139		<p>This won't answer all of your questions but it may be something to think about:</p>  <p>Consider using a solar panel to power the fan. If you only need it running when it's hot (the sun is out) then it makes sense to use solar panel. It can run all day long without incurring energy costs.</p>
140	How should I paint cedar and pressure-treated pine?	<p>I recently built a fence from white cedar (pickets) and pressure-treated pine (posts and rails).  I have been told that I need to wait before painting or staining the fence in order to give the cedar oil and treatment a chance to dry out, but how long should I wait?  (People have told me everything from a few weeks up to a year.)</p>  <p>Is it best to stain or paint?  If I paint, should I use a primer first, or can I go ahead with the first coat of paint?  Should the pressure-treated pine be oiled or treated in some way before staining or painting?</p>
143	How can I fix drooping vinyl siding?	<p>I have vinyl siding on my new home. Starting about a week ago, one segment of siding detached on one end and is drooping. The other side is attached just fine. </p>  <p>I tried snapping it back into place, as it looks like each is just supposed to stay in place by snapping into each other. That lasts for about a few hours, and it starts to sag in the middle and eventually the same end detaches and droops again.</p>  <p>My father in law suggested using a galvanized nail and hammer in the siding, but seems like a brute force bandaid. Is he right? What should I do to fix this? </p>
144		<p>I've heard to wait a year for it to fully dry out (so you could stain it next summer).  I've also heard that you should never paint treated wood, and only use stains specifically designed for treated wood.  </p>  <p>I would talk to the guys at your local paint specialty store though as they would probably know a lot more about that than anyone and be able to tailor their advice to your specific locality (cold winters? hot summers? near salt water? etc.)</p>
145		<p><a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Can_you_refinish_a_bamboo_floor" rel="nofollow">It seems</a> that you can refinish it, pretty much just like any hardwood floor.  However bamboo has a very low burn temperature, so you need to be careful with the sander that you don't burn it.</p>
146		<p>Even though the panels snap to each other they are nailed to the wall at the top edge of the panel. So it's probably a good idea to nail it back. Just make sure it's a little loose because the panels expand and shrink a lot depending on outside temperature.</p>
147		<p>Since the house is 100 years old, the stairs are probably constructed using a tapered groove and wedge system.  The stringers typically had tapered dados cut into them to receive the stair treads.  Wedges were tapped in with glue underneath the tread to lock the tread into place.</p>  <p>Check if this is the case by looking under the stairs.  Hopefully the underside is accessible, if not you might have to remove some drywall or plaster.</p>  <p>If the stairs are constructed using tapered dados, please don't nail or screw the treads in to stop the squeak.  It might work for a year or two, but the treads will expand and contract, loosening the fasteners which will then squeak worse than ever.</p>  <p>Assuming you can get to the underside, find the squeaky stairs.  If the wedges are still there and sound, remove them, clean them, apply glue to the faces and tap them back into place with a hammer, tightening up the stair tread.  If, as is often true, the wedges are missing or splintered/broken, cut a new wedge using an existing wedge as a model.</p>
148		<p>It really depends on the floor. Some flooring is <em>very</em> thin layers over particle board, so sanding can easily eat through all the top layer. Other flooring is thicker. If you can, see if you can figure out the manufacturer and type. If not, the best thing to do is find a place where experiments will not be visible and try sanding. In a kitchen, one great option is under the fridge or dishwasher. If those are easy to roll out of the way, you can get a sander and give it a shot.</p>
149		<p>AFCI's detect patterns of current that usually indicate some sort of electrical problem. Unlike a GFCI which is making sure that current going out = current coming back, AFCI's try to look for electrical usage that would not trip a GFCI but might be something causing an electrical fire. Most code now requires them for bedroom circuits.</p>  <p>The one major drawback for them is that some stuff tricks them into tripping. Often times larger machines with motors, like a vacuum cleaner or power tool can trip them. They are still a good thing to have, just be aware of this limitation</p>
150	Why not put a vent that pushes air from the attic into house?	<p>I have this idea, and since it seems logical to me, but I don't see it anywhere I suspect I am missing something.. so here it is:</p>  <p><strong>Why not put a vent that pushes air from the attic into house?</strong></p>  <ul> <li>At summer, everyone wants to exhaust the hot attic air outside, makes sense.</li> <li>Winter time, the attic still gets hotter, quicker, on cold *<em>sunny</em> day then my house (because I have little direct sun into my house, but also in any well insulated house).</li> <li>why not use the greenhouse "attic" effect, and have a vent sucking the hot air from the attic into the house? you could have that fan linked to a thermostat, only pushing air when attic temp >  house temp... </li> </ul>  <p>seems easy and cheap, what am I missing? </p>
151	What is low VOC paint?	<p>What is low VOC paint, and what is the durability like when compared with 'standard' oil or acrylic based paints?</p>
152		<p>Depends on your climate I guess, but around here in the winter my roof is covered with snow and the attic is cold even on a sunny day.  It seems that if your attic is warmer than your house in the winter, then you either have an insulation or ventilation problem.</p>
153		<p><strong>A good set of channel lock pliers</strong> (multiple sizes). </p>  <p>Use them on almost every job, especially plumbing.</p>  <p><img src="http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/6085/39540403.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
154		<p>There's an alternative to @dilbert789's solution when you're dealing with holes this small:</p>  <ul> <li>cut a rectangle of drywall about three inches larger than your damaged area in both dimensions.</li> <li>score the back of the drywall one inch in from each edge.</li> <li>break the drywall at the score line, and then remove the drywall from the paper.</li> <li>trace the drywall portion of the patch onto the wall, over the damaged area.  (the part that's still solid, not the paper that's 2" larger on each side)</li> <li>cut out along that line.</li> <li>test plug for fit, and if necessary, clean up the edge some</li> <li>put down some drywall mud on the inside of the lip of paper.</li> <li>insert the patch into the hole</li> <li>mud over the edges</li> <li>let dry, sand, and paint.</li> </ul>  <p>I would still use @dilbert789's answer for larger holes, though, or anything in the ceiling, but I had a few incidents of wrestling with strapping when repairing similarly sized holes (fists, doorknobs, etc.), as you need to hold the new reinforcement, the screwdriver, a screw, etc, which gets difficult to juggle for one person.</p>
155		<p><strong>A reciprocating saw (a.ka. sawzall)</strong> -</p>  <ol> <li>Makes short work of any tearout job.</li> <li>Gets into places that other saws can't.</li> <li>Great stand-in for a chainsaw outside (for small stuff)</li> </ol>
156		<p>Aside from the fact that your attic can be very dirty, you need to be concerned about the following:</p>  <ul> <li>If you have any gas heating equipment in the attic (central heat, water heater(s)), they may not meet regulations to allow them to be connected to the house's main air supply. You can run a major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide">carbon monoxide (CO)</a> risk from improper ventilation of gas-burning equipment.</li> <li>Pest control companies can use harsher "dusting" pesticides in attic spaces - stuff you really don't want joining you in the house. Insulation is often loose and can irritating. If you have a much older house that might have asbestos insulation, then you have other problems as well.</li> <li>When you pull air out of the attic, it's repopulated by the air from outside. If the air outside is very cold, your attic could reach new low temperatures, freezing pipes or causing other damage. (This may or may not happen, but it's something I would make sure of before attempting this.)</li> </ul>
157	How can I add/alter wiring inside single-brick walls?	<p>Our house is full-brick. Double-brick on the exterior walls and single-brick for <strong>every</strong> internal wall. It was built in 1979 (I guess they liked to do things properly then).</p>  <p>We've only ever had the opportunity once of adding new electrical items to the single-brick walls (like a heated towel rail, new light switch and powerpoint), when we were renovating as the electrican had to chase a huge chunk out of the wall, lay the cables, and then the hole was filled back up and painted over. That's a pretty major operation.</p>  <p>Is there any other way that we can add or modify the electrical items inside a single brick wall? We now want to run CAT5 and we've got all the external walls done, but not the internals.</p>
158		<p>VOC = <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc.html">Volatile Organic Chemicals</a>.</p>  <p>Basically, it's the stuff that gives you that 'fresh paint' smell, but it also can cause problems for people with sensitivities even after you've aired out the painted room, as the paint will continue to out-gas.</p>  <p>There also exist 'VOC free' paints, not just 'low VOC'.</p>  <p>I can't comment on the durability specifically; it's possible that other aspects of the paint may be a more significant factor.</p>
159	Is air conditioner installation a DIY project?	<p>We got a bargain on a brand new 6.2kw Split System Inverter Air Conditioner.</p>  <p>The quotes we've received for installation are almost as much as the unit cost itself.</p>  <p>Is this something I should be brave enough to attempt myself? It's a back-to-back installation.</p>
160	How can I trace and troubleshoot phone lines?	<p>I have a non-working phone jack that I'm trying to troubleshoot. My house has a lot of strange wiring, and many of the phone lines come together in a messy junction box with random color coding. I suspect one of the wires isn't hooked up correctly, but I'm having trouble tracing the wires. I've tried using the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000GAUXN8" rel="nofollow">LAN Tracker GET-4220T</a>, but I find the results to be very erratic (sometimes all the wires seem to be energized, moving the probe slightly can lose all signal). Even when I am able to get tone from the tracker at the jack, I still can't get dial tone. I've tried swapping out the phone jack itself, as well as the phone.</p>  <p>Is there a good process for tracing phone lines and verifying that they are wired correctly? Is there a better tool than the LAN Tracker that wouldn't break the bank?</p>
161	Fire hazard of exhaust fan with heating bulbs in bathroom?	<p>Our strata gave us permission to install an exhaust fan with 4x 250W heating bulbs into our bathroom. We are on the top floor and the roof cavity above us is the ceiling for the building. There are no firewalls in the ceiling.</p>  <p>I've been told by a friend who's a licensed electrician that these items can be a big fire hazard, as if something catches fire in the bathroom and the fan is on, the fire will be sucked straight into the roof cavity.</p>  <p>What are the chances of this happening? I can't imagine there's much in the bathroom that could catch fire.</p>
162		<p>Those tone generators are fantastic tools for tracing data cabling and phone cabling - but they also have several modes on them.</p>  <p>One of the modes is for tracing the cable through the wall, so the device will beep if it's in the general vicinity, so that you can know where abouts it is without having to have contact with it. However, this is not so great for verifying which cable is the one you've got it hooked onto when you've got a bundle of cables.</p>  <p>For that, there's usually a 2nd mode which will only beep if you come into direct contact with the wire.</p>  <p>The first point of call would be making sure that you've got the tracer set to the correct mode so that it will only beep if you're in direct contact with the wire.</p>  <p>If it's still beeping and in that mode, then you've got a short somewhere, which will be why the cabling isn't working. It might be worth pulling it out and replacing it if you're in a situation where that is possible (your ADSL Sync Speeds might go up drastically if you do that too).</p>
163		<p>Add a second layer of drywall with <a href="http://www.greengluecompany.com/" rel="nofollow">Green Glue</a> for sound isolation; not shilling, just heard very good things about it and plan to use it to soundproof a den. </p>
164	What is the life expectancy of an air conditioning unit with a booster?	<p>Over the weekend my wife and I lost our air conditioning.  I called a technician out to the house and he replaced both the fan motor and the capacitor.  He also had to install a booster to help get my compressor turned over.  I know this solution won't last forever but I was wondering how long my wife and I should have to be able to save up for a new unit.</p>
165		<p>Framing hammers are a specific type of claw hammer.</p>  <p>They often have a textured head, which will reduce the liklihood of skipping off the nail, but will almost guarantee that you mar the wood that you're nailing into.  It can also result in the nail being driven a little bit below the wood.  As such, it's really not useful for finish work.</p>  <p>They also tend to be larger, to help reduce the amount of swings needed to get the nail in (they're really not intended for delicate work), and have a straigher claw to get between two laminated timbers to pull them apart.</p>  <p>If you're only going to buy one -- get a general claw hammer, but I'd recommend using some sandpaper to rough up the face if it's polished smooth.</p>
166	Must I remove asbestos from my heating vents?	<p>I've got an old house with some asbestos tape on the heating vents, and some old floor tiles which are asbestos suspects as well; duct cleaning firms won't do cleaning on the vents with the tape present. Do I really need to call in the space suit guys to get rid of it? If I just cover it with new foil tape, will that encapsulate it safely?  Should I just rip it off myself?</p>

168		<p>Get a professional. Asbestos dust is a real killer, and frankly it's not worth the risk of residual dust - especially if you have young childeren.</p>  <p>In Australia the Queensland government even have a "<a href="http://www.health.qld.gov.au/asbestos/">Dob in a neighbour</a>" program if you think that someone is doing DIY asbestos handeling. That's how serious it is.</p>
169		<p>Not sure about "Sure fire" but a product called CLR (Calcium, Lime, Rust remover) is a good start. </p>
170		<p>I grew up with a furnished basement that only had foam carpet pad covered with carpet. The cinder block walls were coated with UGL drylok and it was lit with flourescent lighting. The foam/carpet worked very well, no drafts, no wet spots, was perfect to lay on. Didn't need to go as far as a subfloor and I live in a harsh winter climate.</p>
171	How can I find places to nail/screw into walls of ICF (insulated concrete form) home?	<p>The home I bought has exterior walls made of ICF (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulated_concrete_form" rel="nofollow">insulated concrete form</a>).  I don't know the brand or type, I just know that somehow the builders attached the drywall to the styrofoam/concrete.</p>  <p>I'm looking to add picture molding and want to ensure it will be secure when hanging weighty items.</p>  <p>I've tried a new stud finder and it doesn't work.</p>  <p>I was under the house the other day and saw the bottom (2") edge of the styrofoam and could not find <em>any</em> change in the styrofoam in the horizontal direction.  I'd expected an embedded strip of something more durable than styrofoam.</p>
172		<p>It's not really that serious in most cases. In tile or siding, it isn't a hazard unless it is broken down, generating dust that you are breathing. Even then, a lot of tile is like 1% asbestos. If you can get it up without breaking it too much, you're basically fine.</p>  <p>Pipe insulation that is soft is more of a problem. You can probably do it yourself if it's a small amount. It may very well be illegal though. Get a respirator like this <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0009XW3ZS">http://www.amazon.com/MSA-Safety-Works-817664-Respirator/dp/B0009XW3ZS</a>, take a heavy plastic bag, tape it around the insulation so it's mostly sealed, and then spray it down with water so it's saturated and won't generate dust. Then remove it, dousing with water as needed. Seal it up in the bag and dispose of it lawfully.</p>  <p>I was an asbestos abatement hygienist for 3 summers, and I took airborne fiber readings of thousands of hours of removal being done. Although negative air containment systems were in place on those jobs, I had probably 10 concerning readings out of thousands.</p>  <p>Asbestos is like smoking cigarettes in my opinion. One day isn't going to hurt you. Every day for 5 years will hurt you.</p>
173	How do I repair aerated autoclaved concrete?	<p>I got an everlasting problem with a aerated autoclaved concrete (also known as "Gasbeton") wall: there's a crack that seems to split the upper half from the bottom half of the wall.</p>  <p>I tried several time to fix it, either with the proper aerated autoclaved concrete putty and with stucco but, after some days, the crack comes back again.</p>  <p>Any idea on how to fix it for good?</p>  <p>EDIT: The wall is made of AAC blocks (as bricks), I have access to both sides and is an interior wall: basically it divides one former big room in two smaller rooms (kitchen and bedroom).</p>
174		<p>As others have said, a framing hammer is a specialty claw hammer. </p>  <p>So what makes it different?  First, weight.  A framing hammer is typically 20-32 oz, compared with 10-16 oz for a "normal" household claw hammer.  That helps it pound large nails in only a few blows.  Related to that is the much longer handle on a framing hammer.</p>  <p>Second is the face of the head: it's waffled to prevent slipping off the nail head, helping prevent bent nails.  A regular claw hammer will sometimes have a textured face but not nearly as pronounced, and the face may also be smooth.  A regular claw hammer often also has a domed face to allow a skilled hand to sink a nail below the surface with minimal surface damage: that's a feature you won't see on a framing hammer.</p>  <p>Third, the claw is straight since it is optimized for prying boards apart.  A regular claw hammer is optimized for pulling nails.</p>  <p>If you're only building a garage, I'd recommend using your regular hammer rather than buying a framing hammer. (Or best of all, just go rent a nail gun!).  For inexperienced carpenters, the time spent hammering will probably not be what slows you down.  Also, the framing hammer is tiring enough that after a couple hours you may actually be faster with a smaller, regular claw hammer.</p>  <p>If you do get a framing hammer I recommend a lighter one.  You'll work faster when you use it, you won't lose much power over a heavier hammer, and you'll feel much better on the second day.  In 2010 if you hammer enough that a 32oz hammer makes a difference versus a 24oz hammer, you have a nail gun anyhow.</p>
175	How do I build a square window frame in an off-square opening?	<p>The original windows in the bedrooms in my old house were huge, far too big for the size of the rooms.  At some point a previous owner replaced them with much smaller windows, building a frame to hold them in the original opening.</p>  <p>I'm planning to replace those windows with something in between which will mean building a new frame.  In at least once case, I would like to use the original framing at the side of the window.  However, due to settling and some warping of the original house frame, the openings are not perfectly square.  I would like to build the frame in advance so that when the time comes, I can just take out the existing windows, cut out the existing frame, put in the new frame and attach the windows.</p>  <p>Beyond careful measuring twice and cutting once, what do I need to do to ensure that the new frame will fit in the opening and be square so that the window installation will go smoothly?</p>
176		<p>I've used CLR with some success.  You can also try a pumice stone.  The stone should be  gentle enough to not scratch the enamel, but tough enough to remove the discoloration.</p>  <p>I removed hard water stains from the inside of an old toilet pretty easily with this approach.</p>
177		<p>It sounds to me that you cut your tip to far down.  Try cutting it closer to the top so the hole is smaller.  A good caulk gun will help too and they aren't too expensive (about $12 at lowes or home depot).</p>
178	Should I insulate an attic that's over an open porch?	<p>I have a 6ft (approx. 2m) wide porch at the front of my house.  The space above the porch opens into the attic, like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/7585/diyquestion.png" alt="Diagram of porch/attic/house goes here"></p>  <p>I'm adding insulation -- R-38 fiberglass batting -- in the attic; do I need to insulate the space above the porch too?</p>
179		<p>Is the porch heated?  If not, then don't bother.  </p>  <p>The purpose of insulation is not to keep the attic warm, but to keep the house warm (or cool).  You actually want the attic to stay relatively close to the outside temperature to prevent ice problems in the winter or overheating in the summer.</p>
180		<p>If it's out of square by less than a quarter to a half inch or so you can probably just use shims to square it up.</p>
181	How can I remove paint from an indoor brick wall?	<p>I have a red brick wall that was painted. I need to figure out an easy method of removing the paint without damaging the brick. Are there any tried and true methods?</p>  <p>One thing to remember is that these bricks have a lot of pores!</p>
182		<p>From what I understand, sandblasting works best, but requires serious machinery/produces huge amounts of dust and noise. Next up is "dry ice blasting" (pellets of dry ice are shot at the wall where they explode, and remove the paint). This is also loud, expensive, and can damage the bricks. You can also just sand the wall with various hand tools (VERY labor intensive).</p>
183		<p>When most people think of a water heating system, they think of a tank (40-75 gal. on average) with a heating source.  However, a robust water heating system probably shouldn't be so simple.  How you want to configure things depends on what your exact situation is, and what features you want maximized.  Some examples:</p>  <p><strong>2 tank, parallel</strong> This kind of setup gives you the storage capacity of both tanks (say, 2 x 40gal = 80gal).  But it also costs twice as much to keep running.  I can't imagine why you would do this over the next idea, but I'm sure someone has a reason.</p>  <p><strong>2 tank, serial</strong> This gives you a lot of versatility in water availability and cost.  In low demand situations, turn the first tank down or off.  Storing the water will let it come up to room temperature, usually reducing the heating requirements in the second tank.  Set tank 2 for your desired temperature.  When demand increases (say, relatives visit for a week) turn the first tank up to boost the inflow temperature.  Ultimately, both tanks at the desired output temperature will give you slightly more hot water than the capacity of both tanks combined; due to heating as water flows.</p>  <p><strong>Tankless</strong> As mentioned by others, a simple tankless heater has hidden drawbacks in demand-based activation and flow restrictions.  However, the do not heat any water unless on, so their standby energy cost is nil.  Installation can be tricky: they require costly ventilation and exhaust systems which can make them not cost-effective over their projected lifespan.  And they are difficult to tie into hot water recycling systems, if you're looking for instant-hot water at the tap.</p>  <p><strong>Tank + Tankless</strong> You're getting into the area of boilers, and options for combining things do very different things.  A pre-warm tank can improve the flow rate of a tankless heater, by reducing the required temperature rise.  A post-heat tank can alleviate the demand-based problems, but adds the cost of continual heating and complexity in cycling cooling water from the tank.</p>  <p><strong>Other</strong> As I mentioned there are thousands of potential ways to combine systems.  Gas is cheaper than electric.  Tankless doesn't have standby costs.  Tanks smooth out warm water flow.  You have to determine your situation, and what works best.</p>  <p><strong>Suggestion</strong> It may be against the TOS to talk brands, if so someone remove this or let me know.  Since we're building a house this summer I've been looking into this problem, and our contractor pointed out the Eternal brand of tankless water heaters.  They have a 2 gallon internal tank that they keep warm, which supposedly fixes the problems of demand-based activation and still costs very little for standby heat.  They integrate well with recirculation systems, and can even be combined in multi-unit setups if demand exceeds one unit.  I've not yet played with it (still building) but the concept looks great on paper.  Oh, and they have less expensive exhaust requirements as well.</p>
184	How do I set up a wiring closet that connects to the exterior of the house?	<p>I'm looking to build a central wiring closet for ethernet, phone, and co-ax.  I would like this closet to have a single pipe to the exterior of the house, which service lines can come in through.  Also, fiber is not currently available, and I'd like it and any future technologies to have easy access to the central closet.</p>  <p>My concerns are:</p>  <ul> <li>What kind of conduit to use</li> <li>How to penetrate the exterior wall <ul> <li>Basement wall is concrete</li> <li>Could also be easily put through main floor siding</li> </ul></li> <li>How to protect the exterior of the conduit from weather</li> </ul>  <p>Hopefully that's all I need to plan the project...</p>
185	Should I replace fallen gutters?	<p>This past winter a heavy snow fall ripped two sets of gutters off our house, and I haven't had a chance to re-hang them yet.  One is over our back door and it's really annoying having the running off hit you when you step out the back door, so they will be replaced as soon as I can.</p>  <p>The other set was over top of a flower bed at an inset corner (so there is a steady stream of water during a heavy rain formed where the two sections of the roof come together).  The only place the water seems to go is into the bed, about a foot from the base of the house. If I can avoid replacing them, I'd like to, but I don't want to risk a bigger issue down the road.</p>  <p>Do I need to replace this second set? Am I risking long-term damage to the foundation or some other issue I'm not thinking of? </p>
186		<p>Your local hardware store should have a selection of conduit that's suitable. Generally any PVC should be OK as it's designed to survive the weather, and does so very well. I used 15mm, but I wasn't running coax - just data cables. An SC fiber connector would not fit through a 15mm conduit, so you'll either have to get a larger conduit than this or get it crimped after it's been through the hole. Go for the larger conduit - it'll be cheaper and easier.</p>  <p>Penetrating the exterior wall depends on what kind of structure your house is built with. Ours is double-brick exterior, so I just drilled through it with a 15mm masonry drillbit and a large hammer-drill. Concrete should be pretty much the same. If you don't have access to a hammer drill, every few seconds stop the drill and pull it back a few cm, then start again. Depending on the thickness of your wall the drill bit will get incredibly hot, so be careful after you've made your hole.</p>  <p>With the exterior conduit, if it's PVC then it should be pretty safe against the weather as it is. If you need to run outdoor connectors outside of the conduit, then IP65 or 67-rated devices should do well.</p>
187		<p>You're likely to need a paint solvent to get it all off.  Since the brick likely absorbed some of the paint, sand blasting will only take you part way there (unless you're willing to remove some of the brick itself).  Here is an okay article on <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/graffiti-removal-in-eight-steps" rel="nofollow">removing graffiti</a>, but regard wall paint is thicker than most spray paint, so you might want to start with sanding (or sand blasting), then switch to the solvents.</p>  <p>Whenever working with solvents indoors, keep in mind making sure there is LOTS of fresh air available to you.</p>
188		<p>You <em>could</em> be risking damage to the foundation. It depends if the bed is properly graded or not. If the bed is graded properly, the water will run away from the house and the foundation. If not, the water could run towards the house.</p>  <p>After a heavy rainfall, see if the foundation concrete close to the dirt looks wet. If it stays wet looking for long after the rest of the foundation has dried, it could mean that water is running towards the foundation.</p>  <p>If that's the case, you have 3 options:</p>  <ol> <li>Fix the gutter.</li> <li>Regrade the bed.</li> <li>Run the risk of your foundation possibly being affected.</li> </ol>

192	How *environmentally* durable are pet-resistant screens?	<p>I've got some damaged wire screens on our porch, and since I have two dogs I've been replacing them with pet-resistant screens made from what appears to be a nylon mesh coated with plastic/rubber.</p>  <p>So far, they seem to work great. They are <em>physically</em> quite durable due to the fact that they stretch some when the dogs jump on them, and this little bit of give keeps them from easily getting holes punched in them.</p>  <p>However, rubbers and plastics can be prone to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodegradation" rel="nofollow">photodegradation</a>, and my porch screens are in direct sunlight for most of the day. Does anyone have any experience/knowledge of how durable pet-resistant screens are from an <em>environmental</em> standpoint? How long can I typically expect them to last before they start to break down due to the elements (mainly sun)?</p>
193	Can I paint over wallpaper?	<p>So I have a wall that has a very hard sort of textured wallpaper. Recently though the wall suffered some damage that turned into a hole. The whole has been patched and now we need to paint over that. <strong>Removing the wallpaper is not an option.</strong></p>  <p>How can I paint over this? Should I use an oil based paint or latex based (or does it even matter)? What are some gotcha's to avoid when painting over wallpaper?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'm not really to concerned  if the texture shows through. I actually like the texture so it's not a big deal.</p>
195		<p>If removing it's not an option, you may want to try a textured paint roller to hide any texture or seams that the wallpaper has.</p>  <p>Also, you should start with an oil based primer, since water based paint and primer can actually seep through the wallpaper and loosen it from the wall.</p>
196		<p>I would never recommend this doing this, but this should give you decent results:</p>  <ol> <li>Pull off anything that is peeling up.</li> <li>Seal it with an oil or shellac based primer (not water based since that will loosen the paper).</li> <li>Once sealed, skim coat it with drywall mud to cover the seams/texturing.</li> <li>Sand, prime again, and paint.</li> </ol>
197	Should my evaporator be hissing? Should cold air be blowing from it?	<p>My A/C hasn't been able to keep up with the heat lately (it's been in the high 90's with high humidity, and today the house was up to about 82 inside even though it's set on 70). I went up into the attic a few minutes ago to see if my untrained eye could see anything wrong with the unit, and I noticed two things:</p>  <ol> <li>There is a hissing noise coming from the unit where the refrigerant lines go into the evaporator. I know that I have a TEV, and I've read online that these can sometimes hiss, but I wanted to see if that's likely what the cause is or if it's possibly something else.</li> <li>Cold air (quite cold) is blowing out of the hole where the refrigerant return line comes out of this box (this is also where I'm hearing the hissing), and the attic was cooler than the rest of my house!</li> </ol>  <p>I just had a popular local A/C company out here to investigate, and he said that the unit appeared to have been undercharged from the time it was installed (the house was built in 2006), so he added two pounds of refrigerant. He said that he didn't find any leaks. Are either of these things issues?</p>

199		<p>Definitely replace the gutter. </p>  <p>Not only are you risking damage to the foundation, but if there's any wind when it rains your walls and windows will receive much more water than they should. This can cause all sorts of other problems like rot, seepage, and suchlike.</p>
200		<p>Was your builder far-sighted enough to run the utilities in conduit? If so then you <em>may</em> be able to run CAT5 through the conduit if there's enough room remaining. </p>  <p>It may also be possible to run the CAT5 through the floor voids, then remove the baseboards / skirting and chase a short distance up the wall beyond. </p>  <p>Alternatively, if the CAT5 is for computer networking, consider wireless. I've just bought a new 802.11n hub and found it brilliant at going through masonry, even with regular 802.11g clients.</p>
201		<p>Two things: </p>  <ol> <li>Most corners or window frames aren't square, so don't use them as the guide.</li> <li>You will have odd-cut tiles at the edges and around the window. </li> </ol>  <p>What you really want to avoid is having the un-cut edge of a tile close to a corner or the window frame. If it's not square then you'll have the straight grout line right next to the not-square line of the wall or window. Your eye will be drawn to this, and you'll indeed get cross every time you lie in the bath. Worse, you may have to cut a tiny sliver of tile to fill an annoying large gap...</p>  <p>In the ideal situation the width of the wall will be an exact multiple of the width of a tile plus the grout line. Then you can adjust things so you have half-a-tile width at the left and half-a-tile at the right. In this case, draw a vertical line dead-centre of the wall and work in both directions from there. </p>  <p>If your wall isn't an exact multiple of the width of a tile plus grout line, start between one-quarter to one-half of a tile to the left or right of this line. It may be best to lay out the tiles on the floor (with spacers!) so you can get a good picture of where the verticals will end up.</p>  <p>Finally, rent or purchase a good diamond tile cutter. Being able to cut tiles easily and quickly is really important, especially if your tiles are large!</p>
202		<p>My dad has a Multimaster and it's truly awesome.</p>  <p>Like any tool, there are jobs it is good for.</p>  <p>There are quite a few tasks I've found where it would have been really useful - mainly in repairs and renovations, where you aren't ripping out whole floor boards or walls or anything.  Those are things where a reciprocating saw, jig saw, circular saw or even a dremel tool (a cutting wheel is always the wrong angle.) won't work well.</p>  <p>He used it to cut out windows of my daughter's playhouse after we put up the plywood walls, and it doesn't do a great job on long cuts like that - he was cutting blind from the inside along the studs and the cuts aren't perpendicular to the sheet (but it's covered with trim).</p>

221		<p>Knob and tube wiring uses two <em>separate</em> copper conductors, each isolated by cotton cloth or soft rubber.  The conductors are strung tightly through the cavities of your walls and floors, and depend on being separated by air in order to avoid overheating.  When going through joists, the wires pass through porcelain <em>tubes</em>.  In the wall and floor cavities, they are attached intermittently by porcelain <em>knobs</em>.</p>  <p>Knob and tube wiring was commonly used in North America from the 1880s through the 1930s.  </p>

226		<p>In cinder block basements I've used a sealant called UGL Drylok. It's a white, thick, paint that seals cinderblock walls and gives a nice white finish to the walls. My parent's house has it on their walls and they haven't had a leak in well over 20 years.</p>  <p>UGL drylok is easy to install but be VERY sure to have alot of ventilation. It works VERY well but has a VERY strong odor and you'll have to heavily ventilate the basement while doing it.</p>

228		<p>A product called "Killz" is an anti mold paint. Might try spraying the area down with a bleach/water mixture (I believe the ratio of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water is sufficient). Spray it down and let it dry. The bleach should kill the mold off in a few days.</p>

230		<p>Knob and tube was the standard long ago. Now it's considered verboten by many insurance companies and is often replaced when a home comes under contract (either the seller replaces it or drops the house price by a significant amount and the buyer replaces it). </p>
231	What is cinderblock?	<p>I live in the UK and have never heard of cinderblock, what is it?</p>
232		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderblock" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderblock</a> - easy way to describe this one. They're just concrete blocks that stack together (much like legos). They're held together with mortar like bricks. They're very common for foundation work in the US.</p>
233		<p>A pocket door is a door that slides into the wall as opposed to opening in or out as a regular door would.</p>  <p>A good comparison would be the sliding doors as most mega-marts or large stores that slide open when you walk towards them or if you're a fan of "Star Trek: The Next Generation". The doors throughout the ship are "pocket doors" (except our pocket doors don't make the neat hissing sound when the open).</p>
234		<p>There might be some confusion because the type of switch you need (<em>single-pole, double-throw</em>) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_terminology">usually called a <em>three-way switch</em> in the US, and a <em>two-way switch</em> in the UK</a>. So for two switches to control the same lights, you need two SPDT switches, and you can find the wiring diagram <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_switching#Two_locations">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
235		<p>There might be some confusion because the type of switch you need is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_terminology" rel="nofollow">usually called a <em>four-way switch</em> in the US, and an <em>intermediate switch</em> in the UK</a>. So for three or more switches to control the same lights, you need two SPDT switches on the ends, and four-way or intermediate switches in the middle. You can find the wiring diagram <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiway_switching#More_than_two_locations" rel="nofollow">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

237	How do I install a water line to my refrigerator?	<p>Recently bought a new refrigerator that has an ice maker and now I want to run a water line to the refrigerator (there is not one there right now).

241	Definitons of various sand, gravel, and rock products	<p>There are various gravel and rock products for sale, but their names do not always mean what the layman thinks they do.  For instance, I ordered three tons of gravel, expecting the 5â15 mm rocks that are commonly used to surface driveways.  What I received was something I would describe as sand with pebbles.  I think what I wanted may be called âcrushed, angular rock,â but I'm still not sure.  (The vendor was nice enough to exchange it for me.)</p>  <p>So: what kinds of sand, gravel, and rock products are sold, what are they called in the trade, and what are they used for?  Pictures welcome.</p>
242		<p>(I actually asked at least partly so I could answer - so here goes):</p>  <p>I bought one of the cheap Harbor Freight variety on sale, and I can see where it would do a <em>great</em> job. Small cuts and getting into corners are some things that it's great at. The example on some of the commercials about trimming some door frame to put in flooring is a perfect example of one thing it's great at. One thing that's especially worth a mention though is that it still has <em>some</em> arc to the end of the cutting path. Not much, but some. The regular blade like this:</p>  <pre><code>^^^^^^^^ |      | |      | |      | |______| </code></pre>  <p>is one of the best ones.</p>  <p>I've already used it to put together several projects. It does a fair job at cutting dovetails - though it doesn't tend to cut super straight through 2x4.</p>  <p>The "safety" part is pretty nice - you can touch the tip of the blade without getting your finger ripped off, but you wouldn't want to leave your finger there.</p>  <p>I've also used the triangular sander and that seems to be really nice - I can see where the carbide piece would be <em>great</em> for removing tile cement. If I am ever involved in that project you can bet I'll be using this oscillator.</p>  <p>One thing I've noticed - you really don't often notice how completely ridiculous this tool looks - it feels like holding a really long "normal" can. It doesn't look or feel like any normal tool (drill, saw, etc) that's designed to be held. For the oscillator it's more of an after thought - but honestly probably the best form for the tool.</p>  <p>Another thing I've discovered is that turning the cutting tool seems to be basically useless - my cuts aren't as straight or easy. The only time it's really good is when using one of those moon/rounded blades.</p>  <p>All in all I'd say the $34 Harbor Freight version belongs in everyone's toolbox. But I probably wouldn't get one of the more expensive varieties unless I were on a job where I was <em>constantly</em> using it.</p>
243	Should I set fence posts in dirt, gravel, crushed rock, or concrete?	<p>I have received conflicting advice about how to set wooden fence posts.</p>  <ul> <li>Many web sites suggest setting them in a <strong>concrete</strong> cylinder.</li> <li>Someone at the local hardware store had seen posts set in concrete rot and break because water seeps in along the edges of the post (especially in the winter) and does not drain properly.  He suggested <strong>crushed rock</strong> (what I would call gravel, see <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/241/definitons-of-various-sand-gravel-and-rock-products" rel="nofollow">Definitions of various sand, gravel, and rock products</a>) instead.</li> <li>A local fence company said they just set the posts in <strong>compacted dirt</strong>, but use 5x5-inch posts.</li> </ul>  <p>What is the best way to set fence posts in different climates, given that the wind force on a 6-foot-tall privacy fence can be substantial?</p>
244	Is there a standard height and depth for stairs?	<p>Is there a standard (or a standard range for) the height and depth of each step in a flight of stairs?</p>  <p>If your answer refers to your building code, please say where you live.</p>
245		<p>The general rule (in the US) is 7-11 (a 7 inch rise and 11 inch run).  More exactly, 7 3/4 rise and an 11 1/2 inch run, although some people will use a run of as little as 9 inches.</p>  <p>You can find some more information <a href="http://www.sizes.com/home/stairs.htm">here</a> as well on other stair-related dimensions.</p>
246		<ul> <li>Couple inches of gravel.  </li> <li>Place post.  </li> <li>Level, plumb.  </li> <li>Fill with concrete.</li> </ul>  <p>Make sure that the concrete is graded away from the post so water runs off, this is an important step that lots of people overlook.  Taking the time now to make sure water moves away from the post, will save time and money later when the posts don't have to be replaced.</p>  <p>*Also make sure the concrete is above the ground around it.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaZWE.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

250		<p>A ring main as the name implies, is a wiring ring between a circuit breaker on a consumer unit and the sockets it supplies. </p>  <p>One wire leaves the consumer unit and connects to the first socket, a second cable then leaves this socket and goes to the next, at the last socket in the chain, the last connection goes back to the consumer unit creating a ring. The power load is shared both ways around the ring allowing use of a smaller diameter cable than a radial wiring system. This smaller diameter was one of the principle reasons for its introduction after the war in order to reduce the amount of copper which was in fairly short supply. </p>  <p>Older wiring systems have remained in use until fairly recently, my grandparents house was only rewired in 1987 although many were converted earlier.</p>  <p>The wiring scheme has some criticisms including less apparent fault symptoms and more lengthy testing requirements which aside from the complexity of retroactively adopting a new standard have probably contributed to its limited use outside the UK.</p>  <p>The Wikipedia article contains some more details on the standard, its history and issues but adequate training should be arranged before making any modifications to existing circuits.</p>  <p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_circuit">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_circuit</a> </p>  <p>It's worth noting as well before considering any work that Part P of the Building Regulations may well apply, the IET has a good faq on the subject which is worth reading:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.theiet.org/publishing/wiring-regulations/part-p/">http://www.theiet.org/publishing/wiring-regulations/part-p/</a></p>
251		<p>T-111 is pretty much the standard for that kind of stuff.  What kind of a look are you going for?  You could always sheath it with OSB and put anything you want on top of that (vinyl, clapboard, etc.)</p>
252		<p>I'd grind/scrape away the grout first and then gently tap the middle of the tile with a screwdriver until it shatters and chip it out. It'll probably take a while to do it but you should be able to scrape/chip away the old thinset, apply new thinset then regrout.</p>  <p>best of luck !</p>
254		<p>They make "taps" specifically for that purpose - you can get them at home depot/lowes or probably any plumbing store.  </p>  <p>They clamp on to an existing water line and have a sharp pin inside.  You attach a vinyl or flexible copper line to it and run it through the floor to the fridge.  Then you crank handle on the valve down and the pin punctures the copper water line and lets water into the valve.  </p>  <p>When I did mine, I was a bit worried it would leak at first (they just look like something that wouldn't seal well) but haven't had any problems with it for well over a year now.</p>
255	When should you use metal studs?	<p>When does it make sense to use metal framing for an interior wall? What are the advantages to traditional wood framing?</p>
256		<p>Typically I hit the first one (kind of gently) with a hammer until it cracks/shatters.  Grind out the grout then pry out the pieces with a chisel or just a beefy flathead screwdriver.  </p>  <p>Once you have one out, you should be able to use a chisel or a flat head screwdriver to get under the other ones.  Put the screwdriver under/against the edge of the tile and tap it with a hammer and the tiles will (usually) just pop off.  Some will be more stubborn than others, but if you're reasonably careful you shouldn't damage the wall much.</p>
257		<p>Around here they are generally only used in commercial construction or in buildings where flamable building materials like wood are not allowed.  Wood is just much easier to work with generally.</p>  <p>Some advantages of metal over wood:</p>  <ol> <li>They don't burn.</li> <li>They are always straight.</li> <li>Easier to run electrical through (come with holes, so no drilling needed).</li> </ol>  <p>And wood over metal:</p>  <ol> <li>Easier to work with (cut, shape, toe nail, etc).</li> <li>Stronger.  You can't use metal studs for load bearing walls.</li> <li>While metal is generally cheaper than wood, the extra accessories needed (special boxes, conduit, etc) can make it more expensive.</li> <li>Wood is generally easier to get - most of the big home shops don't carry steel studs.</li> </ol>
258		<p>Septic systems leach out into the surrounding area (called a "leach field"). This helps reduce the number of times the system needs pumped out. Liquid (and some solid) waste is broken down and leaches out into the field. Some municipalities don't like this because it has the potential to contaminate local water sheds (most notably if you're near a river).</p>  <p>A cesspool is a sealed tank for holding waste. Since it's sealed it doesn't leak but frequently needs drained. More expensive than a septic system but more environmentally friendly.</p>  <p>Most places in the US that don't have city sewer services have a septic tank as far as I'm aware. I haven't heard of many cesspools.</p>
259		<p>There are a few different ways I've seen this done.</p>  <p>The best way is to trench around the outside of the foundation down to the footer, seal the outside of the wall, and install a drainage system (gravel and pipes) at the footer to redirect the water to a sump pit where it can be pumped out.</p>  <p>Next best way is to do basicly the same thing, but on the inside of the house.  You bust up the concrete floor of the basement along the walls and install gravel and PVC pipe under the floor to drain the water to a sump pit where it can be pumped out.</p>  <p>Both those options are going to be pretty expensive, and probably not something you would want to tackle on your own.  Which is why many people opt to simply seal the inside of the walls with a product like Drylok as Scott mentions.  It's pretty effective if you only have minor moisture problems, but if you regularly get lots of water in the basement, it's probably not going to solve your problem.</p>
260		<p>Allowing rainwater to free fall from the roof can cause cosmetic issues, like dirt splatter all over your foundation and siding, but will also contribute to water in your basement.  The function of the gutter is to redirect this water away from the house so it doesn't gather up against the foundation below grade.</p>

263	Are tankless water heaters worth it in cold climates?	<p>I was thinking of switching over to a tankless water heater, but a friend of mine said they are not good in colder climates since the water coming in is colder and takes longer to heat.  Is this a valid concern, or are these things designed to deal with this type of thing?</p>
264		<p>I live in Michigan, so it get's pretty cold here, and I'm pretty happy with my tankless water heater.  Might want to check out my answer to <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/61/which-water-heater-types-do-you-recommend/75#75" rel="nofollow">this question</a> for some other pros/cons though.</p>
265		<p>I know PEX is cheaper (specially considering the rising price of copper), easier to run and less noisy than copper but you have to buy a special crimping tool for the fittings (don't know how expensive the tool is). My only fear would be long term effects depending on water type. For instance I have very hard water (very high calcium content; I should NEVER have to worry about osteoporosis) and I wonder what will happen 10, 15, 20 years down the road to the PEX pipe based on the minerals in the water.</p>  <p>I'm also not sure if there are any long term health effects from having water run over PVC. Not sure what kind of chemicals leach into the water over time. I'm 99.99% sure it's safe though.</p>
266		<p>Generally the durability is considered to be just as good as the older paints. The VOC-Free paints still have less color-selection (at least last time I looked), but that's been changing as demand increases.</p>  <p>The building I work in (in the U.S.) just completed a LEED-Platinum renovation, and used all VOC-Free or Low-VOC paints. Some of the special purpose paints were not available in VOC-free yet, but low-VOC paints covered most of what they needed (including paint for a metal roof).  </p>  <p>I was impressed at how much less they smelled when I stood next to a painter with an open tray of paint for several minutes before realizing he had fresh-paint out (I was disappointed that it smelled like someone had painted a week before until I realized he was doing the touch-up painting right then).  In the first year we haven't seen any issues related to durability.</p>
267		<p>A small pancake compressor.  You can easily borrow / rent the tools, but having the compressor for so many jobs comes in handy.  Can also be used without a tool to blow stuff off, fill tires, etc.</p>
268		<p>You need to:</p>  <ol> <li>If possible - remove the source of dampness (not always possible)</li> <li>Dry the area</li> <li>Paint on a damp-seal product (many available)</li> <li>Once dry you can paint over the damp seal.</li> </ol>  <p>Good luck</p>
269		<p>There is a dremel tool called the multi-max that I have used before. You can get a diamond attachment for it that will cut through grout like butter. Once you get the grout out you should be able pop up the tile and replace it.</p>
270		<p>If you don't want to cut the existing line or hire a plumber, a tap is the best option, but it will eventually leak.  In addition, if you have hard water, the small whole can become clogged with deposits.</p>
271	How do I insulate around a gas fireplace without tearing it apart?	<p>My home has a gas fireplace that we do not use very often. It is in a "bump out" on the back of the house.  In the winter, cold air flows through the vents under the fireplace and if  you feel the tile around the fireplace, it is cold.  Is there a good method to insulate around it without tearing apart the fireplace?  What type of insulation should I use that would not be a fire hazard.</p>
272	How do you paint vinyl shutters?	<p>What kind of paint will work for restoring the original color to vinyl shutters that have faded from exposure to the sun? They are supposedly "maintenance-free" but the home owners association says they need to be repaired or replaced.</p>
273	Is it a good idea to pay for an energy saving audit of my new home	<p>We have a newly built home but I'm not at all confident in the builder's prowess when it comes to energy conservation.  Is it worth hiring someone (like our energy provider or other specialized contractor) to do an energy audit?  Or do you think they would most likely find something whether or not there was a problem so they can charge us more for the fix?  </p>  <p>If no energy audit, does anyone have any tips for the best ways to look for these "leaks" myself?  </p>
274		<p>I recently repainted mine after aging 5 years.  They are maintenance free, but the color will fade.  Sherwin Williams sells paint specifically for shutters and they had an exact match for my shutter color.  You just wash and paint.  They'll look as good as new!</p>
275		<p>You can hire a company to scan your house with an infra-red camera. I've never hired one so I'm not sure of the expense but they'll go around your house with the camera and see where cool (or hot) air is escaping and give you report about it. I'm sure it's a few hundred dollars to get it done but it might be worth it if you think you have some major leaks.</p>
277	What are these spongy/soft spots on my hardwood floor?	<p>The house I recently bought has hardwood floors, but I've noticed that some spots are spongy when I walk over them. There is visible downward flex in certain spots to an observer of someone walking across the room. I took a coin and tapped across the floor, and the spongy spots have a hollow sound.</p>  <p>What is the cause of this, and is there a remedy without tearing out the whole floor?</p>
279	How do I secure a toilet bowl to a tile floor?	<p>The bathroom in my house was redone right before I moved in. After moving in, I noticed the toilet is loose. It seems to only stay in place due to it's sheer weight, and it has quite a lot of jostle whenever it's sat on. The floor in the bathroom is ceramic tile. </p>  <p>How can I safely secure the toilet to the floor without risking ruining the title? Also, are there any plumbing issues to be corncerned about?</p>
281	Why won't my shower's temperature handle let the water get hot enough?	<p>Whenever I go to take a shower, I have to turn the handle to the absolute hottest setting just to avoid freezing. I know the hot water works in my house, so that's not the issue. It just seems like I should be able to make the water hotter if I could just turn the handle more. Is there a way to accomplish this easily?</p>
283		<p>The cause is generally that the flooring or subfloor is not securely attached to the joists underneath.  Usually this happens because the joist settle or bend over time and the flooring becomes loose or detached in spots.</p>  <p>If you can get underneath the floor and find the soft spots (say from the basement or crawlspace?), you'll likely see that there is a gap between the flooring and the joist.  Just get a chunk of 2x4 and sister it to the joist so that the flooring sits on top of the 2x4 with no gap between them.  </p>  <p>If that doesn't stop the spongyness, you might want to use some clips or small angle brackets with short nails or screws to attach the flooring to the 2x4 from the bottom, or toe-nail through the 2x4 and into the bottom of the flooring (but be careful not to go all the way through it of course)</p>
284		<ul> <li>Dig your hole to a depth appropriate for the height of the post.</li> <li>Place a pre-cast concrete biscuit (block). It should be a couple inches thick and can be square or round, but the round ones usually fit the hole more easily.</li> <li>Place your post in the hole and backfill with dirt.</li> </ul>
285		<p>A lot of utility providers will provide a basic home energy audit for free. If this is the case, it's a no-brainer. </p>  <p>If they don't provide an actual audit, then they often provide statistics for what an average home should be consuming, so you can assess if you think you're using too much. </p>  <p>Besides for that, you can check for drafts or cracks in windows and doors yourself as a basic audit. </p>  <p>After that, I've found just be living in my home, I can tell if a room is too hot or cold compared to the rest of the house, and then look for problems then. </p>  <p>With all that said, I think that you should take a long view. If you have no free audit options, and you can find an affordable paid service, it'll most likely be worth it in the long run. </p>
286		<p>How old is your hot water heater? I ask because I ran into the same issue. I'd turn my shower on full hot, no cold water at all and I'd still only get warm - semi-hot water when realistically I should have been scalded. Turns out my hot water heater was set too low (was set on the "A" setting out of "A, B and C" with "C" being the hottest). I set it to "C" and that solved the issue for a while. It started doing it again, I called around and found out that as a hot water heater gets older it loses it's heating capability. My water heater was about 12 years old and wasn't heating efficiently. Got a new water heater and now I get steaming hot water again.</p>
287	How do I add more circuit breakers once the breaker box is full?	<p>My house was completely rewired by the previous owner.  They tore out all the old knob-and-tube and replaced it with modern wiring.  I definitely appreciate this, but unfortunately they left absolutely no extra space on the new breaker box.  Every single slot is filled with a circuit breaker.</p>  <p>It's not that the circuits are doled out too liberally either.  Its just a small breaker box.  It fits the requirements of the house exactly, but leaves no room for future expansion.</p>  <p>So, what are my options for adding more breakers?  Can I add a sub breaker box?  Or should I just replace the whole thing with a larger one?</p>
288	What's the best approach to repair a wedge/corner crack in my foundation?	<p>I've got a <a href="http://www.repairfoundation.net/2006/12/12/a-piece-of-concrete-has-fallen-from-my-house-can-ruin-be-far-behind/" rel="nofollow">wedge/corner crack</a> on one corner of my foundation. I'll try to post a picture of it as soon as I can, but here's a sample image of what I'm talking about:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.repairfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/corner_wedge-300x225.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>However, my crack is more complex. There are actually two pieces. The upper piece looks like the one in the picture above, and the lower piece looks like a mirror image, such that the two broken pieces of the corner are wedged against one another at their tips.</p>  <p>This makes repair problematic, since the two pieces are wedged against one another so well that I can't pull either free to put any kind of repair compound on the back side of the cracked pieces. If I simply fill over the crack, I'm worried that it won't be strong enough to hold the pieces to the foundation, and it will just crack again.</p>  <p>How would you suggest that I should proceed? I'm thinking I have these two general options:</p>  <ul> <li>Try to inject some repair compound as deep into the cracks as I can, hoping that I'll get it deep enough to bond the pieces to the foundation.</li> <li>Do my best to remove the pieces so that I can apply repair compound directly to the back surface, even if that means doing more damage to the pieces themselves.</li> </ul>
289		<p>From <a href="http://www.pexinfo.com">Pex Information</a>:</p>  <ul> <li>Flexible PEX tube is manufactured by extrusion, and shipped and stored on spools, where rigid plastic or metal piping must be cut to some practical length for shipping and storage. This leads to several advantages, including lower shipping and handling costs due to decreased weight and improved storage options.</li> <li>PEX plumbing installations require fewer fittings than rigid piping. The flexible tubing can turn 90 degree corners without the need for elbow fittings, and PEX tubing unrolled from spools can be installed in long runs without the need for coupling fittings.</li> <li>Attaching PEX tube to fittings does not require soldering, and so eliminates the health hazards involved with lead-based solder and acid fluxes; PEX is also safer to install since a torch is not needed to make connections..</li> <li>PEX resists the scale build-up common with copper pipe, and does not pit or corrode when exposed to acidic water.</li> <li>PEX is much more resistant to freeze-breakage than copper or rigid plastic pipe.</li> <li>PEX tubing does not transfer heat as readily as copper, and so conserves energy.</li> <li>Water flows more quietly through PEX tube, and the characteristic "water hammer" noise of copper pipe systems is virtually eliminated.</li> <li>PEX plumbing installations cost less because: <ul> <li>PEX is less expensive than copper pipe.</li> <li>Less time is spent running pipe and installing fittings than with rigid pipe systems.</li> <li>Installing fewer fittings reduces the chances for expensive callbacks.</li> </ul></li> </ul>  <p>If you are only going to be doing a little bit of work, check with your local rental stores, you may be able to rent the tool for a decent price.</p>
290		<p>I've had success using aluminum spray paint to cover old water stains on the ceiling.</p>
291	What's the best way of replacing a plug or switch in a house with aluminum wiring?	<p>My house has aluminum wiring, which from what I understand isn't recommended any more. How do I replace a plug or switch since the new unit only takes copper wiring?</p>
292		<p>Here's what I did in my house, based on internet research and asking my Dad, a construction superintendent.</p>  <ol> <li>Buy some wire nuts made for multiple types of wire and some anti-corrosion compound (usually available in the same area of the hardware store).</li> <li>Take some copper wire and twist it together with the aluminum wire.</li> <li>Put the compound on the wire and some inside the wire nut.</li> <li>Twist the wire nut onto the wire twist you made.</li> <li>Use the new copper end to connect to the new plug/switch.</li> </ol>
293		<p>It really depends on how many breakers you intend on adding and what level of service you're already getting. Most of the time, the number of circuits in your breaker box corresponds to the level of service you're getting. </p>  <p>Personally, I'd recommend getting an electrician for this to calculate your energy needs. </p>  <p>However, if you know you have adequate power, and you're only interested in adding one or two circuits, you can use piggy back breakers to split the space normally reserved for one breaker into two. </p>  <p>As always, make sure you're using parts that are specified as appropriate by the manufacturer. </p>
294		<p>My parent's house has aluminum wiring. You can either search for CO-ALR switches and plugs which take aluminum wires or get the paste as you said and wire them together. The paste is important, otherwise the wires corrode and start rubbing/sparking .... bad mojo from there.</p>
295	How should I prepare doors and windows for painting?	<p>I'm mostly interested in what is the best way to protect the wood from bad weather, but any other advice on how to improve overall quality of work would be appreciated.</p>
296		<p>For a non-floating floor, you would stand on the squeaky part while someone screwed in through the sub-floor in to the squeaky part of the floor.</p>  <p>I've never dealt with floating floors before, but I assume this is not an option because the movement might cause cracks?</p>
297		<p>On each side of the toilet base you should find a rounded cover. Pry these off and that should expose the bolts that hold the toilet to the base plate. Start by gently tightening these bolts. You should use a wrench, but don't over-do it.</p>
298		<p>I've used them before and they do make it a lot easier, especially if you have trouble keeping paper still from moving in the corners, as I do. I don't think they have any structural benefits or anything like that so if you have trouble with paper tape, try them out in a corner and see if it's easier. You can always take it out and go over it with tape if you need to.</p>
299		<p>Doityourself has a good article called <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/stry/how-to-repair-a-shower-faucet-water-doesnt-get-hot" rel="nofollow">"How to Repair a Shower Faucet: Water Doesn't Get Hot"</a> that covers how to troubleshoot and repair a cartridge-type shower faucet, which I suspect is your problem.</p>
300	What are the pros and cons of LED lighting for home use?	<p>I'm interested in installing LED lights in my home, and I'm having a dilemma between buying LED bulbs and rolling my own solution. I have some questions on how to DIY:</p>  <p>How efficient is it?   Single 1W led can yield about 90lm which sounds impressive, but when coupled with rectifier losses, dimmer, and resistors, what lm/W should I expect for 8 * 3 leds on 12V transformer?</p>  <p>Quality of light?   How comparable the warm white is to fluorescent light-bulbs? Would mixing few yellow LEDs yield nicer color?</p>  <p>Other things to consider?</p>
301		<p>If tightening the bolts on the toilet doesn't work, you may have a cracked flange underneath the toilet. You don't mention how much it moves but if it's a lot, I would recommend pulling up the toilet (make sure to plug the sewer hole with a towel!) and making sure everything still looks okay underneath, including the flange and wax seal. A badly rocking toilet can lead to a leaky wax seal. If nothing is broken try to determine if the floor is just sloped or something that can be fixed with a shim or something to level out the floor.</p>  <p>If the toilet isn't moving that much, you can slide a metal or plastic shim underneath from the outside.</p>  <p>Just be aware that a lot of plumbers consider a rocking toilet to be a precursor to a leaking toilet so if it's been rocking for awhile you might want to take a look underneath just to be safe.</p>
302		<p>Strip off all the old paint and sand the wood very well. Then use a good primer that seals the wood that water cannot enter it. Finally paint the wood in a colour of choice.</p>
303		<p>The only reason to replace the entire box is if aesthetics: if there isn't enough room on the wall for two boxes, or the box is in a closet or cabinet where there isn't physical space.</p>  <p>Putting in a new breaker box is much easier than replacing an entire box.  If you replace the entire box, you will need to rewire every breaker.  When the original box was wired there was lots of slack on each wire, but after each breaker was installed the wires would have been trimmed.  A good electrician will allow slack in the wires for reconfiguring breakers, etc. but if it's a small box you may not have enough wire, or you may end up running the wires in ways that aren't as neat or professional as it should be.</p>  <p>With a new box, on the other hand, you only need to remove one 220V or two adjacent 110V breakers.  The old wires can be run into a junction box to provide as much length as you need for wiring into the new box. </p>  <p>As Mike Sherov noted, you need to be sure that your service can handle the load and number of circuits.  That'll be a location specific code issue.  If the knob-and-tube wiring was recently replaced I'd be surprised if the old service (probably 50 or 60 amp) wasn't upgraded as part of that process (likely to 150 or 200 amps). </p>  <p>If your new circuits are within the capacity of your service and local regulations permit, this is a job you can do yourself.  If you choose to do it yourself, in some jurisdictions you can ask the inspector if your plan will keep you in code, to save the cost of a consultation with an electrician.  (In some places of course, they're too busy for such questions.)  Or you can research it yourself: it's not difficult if you have access to a code book.</p>
304		<p>Many faucets have an adjustable range.  In the last one I installed there was plastic ring with v-grooves around the outside of it: to adjust the range you positioned two stops that hooked into the v-grooves.</p>  <p>Recommend the TIA* approach to see what you can see - it may be very straightforward.  Just don't drop the screws down the drain!</p>  <p>*Take It Apart</p>
305		<p>Another advantage to PEX if you're doing a from-scratch installation is that it's typically installed using a manifold at the water source with a run to each faucet.  That approach significantly reduces pressure loss at one faucet when another faucet on the same branch is turned on, as often happens with copper plumbing.</p>  <p>You could do the same thing with copper, of course, but it would be prohibitively expensive in time and materials.</p>
306	Additional Vapor Barrier with Faced Insulation?	<p>When installing faced insulation into exterior walls, are there any benefits or detriments to adding an additional vapor barrier to either the non-faced side of the insulation?</p>
307		<p>In my area metal studs are not cheaper than wood studs, but still widely used by pros.  That leads me to think that there must be a big time savings with metal once you're experienced.  In a large installation the consistency of metal makes follow-on work like electrical and drywall go much faster.</p>  <p>I only used metal once, and found that it was slower than wood for a DIY guy like me.  I can pick-and-choose my studs so there isn't a drywall issue for the small jobs I do.</p>  <p>In short, if you're finishing your basement or adding a wall in a remodel, I'd stick with wood.  If you're framing an entire house metal might be worth the investment in tools and learning.</p>
308		<p>Last summer we rebuilt our fence using advice from <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1580175309">The Fence Bible</a>.  The advice was great, and the directions clear.  The author covered both concrete and compact dirt/rock footers for wooden fences. I'd highly recommend it to anyone building a fence for the first time.</p>  <p>Concrete does risk rotting the wood because of water build up, but that can be mitigated with proper drainage. Dirt footers can be problematic if you have very loose dirt in your yard.  Dirt requires lots of work with something heavy to compact it, concrete requires mixing and handling concrete.</p>  <p>We set ours in dirt/gravel and realized it was exactly the right choice when our fence was hit by a car 4 months after we built it. The car shattered two 4x4 posts, a gate, and several rails, a 3rd posts was pulled from the ground, and every other post along the run titled about 5 degrees including a 6x6 corner post; 10 posts had to be reset in all. Our neighbor (whose fence was also hit) had concrete footers, which were pulled from the ground, or shifted several inches but left in the ground. His footers had to be removed and replaced, and all new posts were required. We had to replace the damaged parts (2 posts, a gate and several rails), but we could reset the others. If we'd had concrete I suspect more would have broken, and we would have been unable easily reset any that had titled (granted fewer might have tilted but that energy had to go somewhere, hence the assumption about more broken posts).</p>
309		<p>Mix in a few other colors as well, then use a microcontroller to mix a suitable color based on time of day, mood, and the music that is currently playing.</p>
310		<p>In our new house, the shower controls in the kids bathrooms are adjustable so you can set the temperature to prevent scalding. Even if the kids push the control all the way to HOT, the water will only be comfortably warm.</p>  <p>I'm not sure about all controls, but on ours you pop the face off the control. Inside there are 2 (I think) geared rings that you can position to set the maximum temperature.</p>
311		<p>@eric-petroelje has it right: you need a weeping tile system on the outside of the foundation so that water drains away from the foundation at its base.  Installing it after-the-fact means digging down to the footings around each wall in turn.</p>  <p>If you have a high water level, there is no product on the planet that can resist the hydro pressure from the water table.  You need to divert the water, not resist it.</p>  <p>While the side of the foundation is exposed there are several products you can treat the exterior concrete with: essentially spray-on sealants that will give you a first-class job.  I've only seen that on TV, though.  The three times I've helped with this kind of job the exterior sealant was not applied and there was no leakage afterward.</p>  <p>There are companies that specialize in this: in my area installing weeping tile around the perimeter is a job in the 50k range.  My dad did it to two of his rental houses using a spade, though: it can be done if you're not a lazy GenX-er like me.</p>  <p>If your moisture problems aren't severe, and you don't want to commit to an expensive job like this, you could see if a sump pump solves it for you.  Essentially you dig a 1 ft square hole in the basement floor, down about four feet, and install a pump to discharge accumulated water outside before it becomes a problem.  That's a solution somewhere between the DryLok approach and the weeping tile.</p>
312		<p>Many issues here. Let me go over in as much detail as possible: Background: I love energy efficiency, and when doing my kitchen researched this LED Vs CFL vs incandescent lights extensively. Notice there are also <strong>permit</strong> (legal) implications, depending on which state you leave (CA has Title 24 for example).</p>  <p>Connector types: There are several connectors that make the decision of which light you can use tricky. the main ones are</p>  <p><strong>Edison</strong>: The screw type, accepts CFL, Incandescent and some LED bulbs</p>  <p><strong>Pins (2 or 4)</strong>: Accepts florescent. Was invented mostly so that for permits purposes, they can make sure you are installing an efficient light and will not go and replace the CFL bulb with an incandescent one after you pass the permit.</p>  <p><strong>GU10</strong>: mostly used for high voltage halogen </p>  <p><strong>GU5.3 Bi- Pin</strong>: mostly used for low voltage halogen</p>  <p>High level rules:</p>  <ul> <li><p>You never go with incandescent when it is incandescent Vs CFL (Edison, screw system). LEDs are getting there, but not enough to justify the price and their light output is very low.</p></li> <li><p>You can only go with pin florescent if you have a florescent "hw". that is the only thing that you can plug there by design.</p></li> <li><p>Never use Halogen. If it is a GU10 (line voltage), get a $20-$30 LED (MR16). you get 4W Vs 35W. Light output is lower, but you can get HW with simply more heads. Replace 3 halogen with 5 LEDs and you are fine in terms of light and energy savings</p></li> <li><p>If the halogen is a low voltage, things get tricky. You can just replace the head with a 3-5W bi-pin LED. they run $10-$20. They problem is that you need to make sure your low voltage converter will work. converters have what's called "minimal load". For most of them, they expect a 35-50W halogen so they have a minimal load of 10-20. That means that when you plug a 3W LED, they may not kick in. you solve it by either using a remote transformer that feeds "enough" LED bulbs, or get a transformer that is "led" designed, but really all it means is that it has a minimal load of 3w and goes all the way up to something (I have a 3-60W for mono-points).</p></li> </ul>  <p>Lat general tip: do not mess with dimmers. Just on/off.</p>  <p>My personal choices: For kitchen recessed light I got LED <a href="http://amzn.to/blMkWO">LR6-GU24</a>. It is 12W, think that the florescent way would suggest I put a 23W bulb for each of these (I have 7). That means 50% saving. Same light output (they say it is 65W equivalent, but it feels like closer to 90W). No one can tell it is LED BTW, it is bright and even (not a "pin" of light, and well spread). Cost efficient: great! less energy, and upfront cost was the same as getting a florescent can combination. (you may get cheaper florescent if it is not for a permit and you do the Edison type)</p>  <p>For a bat lights I went with 3 mono points. Each has a transformer built in. I did not (suggest you never) buy "LED" lamps since you pay a huge premium for getting the LED HW. I just got the transformer with minimal load of 3W. I then threw away the GU5.3 Bi- Pin halogen and got <a href="http://amzn.to/bkn4Gz">Maxxima LED MR16</a>. They are very good price (value) company. I compared the light to a $30 GE and these one are just as good. Notice that at 3W it is indeed just ambient light. good for over the bar in addition to some other light in the room. If you need more power, get 4 or 5W bulbs. see <a href="http://www.maxximastyle.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=LB">maxxima site</a></p>  <p>For spotlight lights in the center of medium size room, I went with much cheaper "line voltage" fixture from Lowes. These fixtures expect GU10 halogen (25-50W). I got in this case a the more expensive $30 LED GU10 bulbs (GE, at home depot). They are great, but I hope you can do better on the price. I have 5 and for medium size dining room, correctly targeted, it is nice light to use while eating.</p>
313		<p>Not what you asked, but for safety the most important thing, even more important IMO than getting the right rise and run, is that every step is consistent.  Varying as little as 1/4 inch in rise will make even a ballerina fall on her face if she's running up the stairs.</p>
314	Is it worth it to insulate hot water PEX tubing?	<p>Is it worth the time and expense to put the foam pipe wrap on pex hot water pipes?  I've seen mixed statements. </p>  <p>What is your thought?  But more importantly, can you back it up?</p>
316	Is insulating an unfinished basement worth it? If so, how should I go about it?	<p>I have an unfinished, well waterproofed basement with cinderblock walls and a concrete floor. All but the top 6 inches / 15 cm or so is underground.</p>  <p>Would it be worth insulating the walls down there? How would I do it? We have pretty long, cold winters and the summers are generally mild - a few 90 degree F days, but mostly high 70s to 80s.</p>
317		<p>You would insulate it by building a false wall in front, insulating with fiberglass batt's(sp?) and putting on a vapor barrier of plastic.</p>  <p>For the false wall, some do 2x4's, others 2x3's. Some put the studs on 16" centers, others 2'.  If you ever plan on finishing off the basement, I would recommend 2x4 &amp; 16".  </p>
318		<p>I live in the midwest with the same climate and my parent's house is almost exactly as you describe yours. Well waterproofed, cinderblock (painted with UGL drylok), concrete floor (their basement is carpeted) and no insulation. As a child I spent many an hour playing down there and was never cold, even on the coldest winter days. So I'd say no, I see no need to insulate.</p>
319		<p>Can't really answer the worth it part, but for the how I would say use polystyrene foam board.   <a href="http://www.homeconstructionimprovement.com/basement-insulation/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a quick run down on how to do it.</p>  <p>It might be a good idea to insulate.  You might not feel cold/hot due to the outside temperature, but you most likely are wasting money on your heating/cooling bills.  Just because you don't feel cold in a room, doesn't mean your not running the heater too much to keep it that way.</p>
320	How do I lay asphalt shingles on a roof, and what should be under them?	<p>How do I lay asphalt shingles on a roof, and what should be under them?  Are they self-adhesive?  Can I stick them directly onto plywood?</p>
321	Buying and installing vinyl siding	<p>My house has vinyl siding.  I am considering installing vinyl siding on a shed also.  How do I find siding to match what I already have on my house?  (It is only a year or two old, but installed by the previous owner.)  Can I expect to find what I need at the local Lowe's or Home Depot, or are many brands of vinyl siding only sold by specialty retailers or directly to contractors?</p>  <p>Looking at my house, there seem to be a lot of different pieces: regular, top, and bottom boards; corner pieces; special pieces around doors, windows, sillcocks, and electrical outlets; and so on.  How do I find out what pieces I need?  Is that particular to each manufacturer?</p>
322		<p>Considering that it's underground and insulated by 5 or so inches of concrete, so I would bet it's already much better insulated that the rest of your house.  Also, in the winters the ground temp is usually warmer than the air temp, so that would tend do make things even better.</p>  <p>If it's cold down there in the winter it's probably because you don't have any heat vents in the basement (many houses don't, or they are always closed).</p>  <p>If you have those crappy single-pane "basement windows" though, I would recommend you replace them with glass block.  That would almost certainly be worth the money.</p>
323	Do they make a non-liquid concrete/mortar color additive?	<p>I've been trying to find a cement additive to change the color of some mortar, but only seem to be able to find it in liquid form at my local big-box hardware store. </p>  <p>I'm looking for a similar product that can be added to dry mortar mix. Does this even exist? Where can I find it?</p>  <p>Back-story: I put down a patio of pavers a few years ago and apparently didn't put down thick enough plastic sheeting underneath. I skimped because the area seemed too shady to promote much weed growth. Boy was I wrong. I have major weeds growing through the cracks between the pavers. </p>  <p>My plan is to power wash the patio to get most of the sand out between the pavers, and then replace it by sweeping dry mortar over the patio and then misting it so it will harden and form a barrier for the weeds between the pavers. To get the color right I'd need to mix the color into the dry mortar before spreading it. I'm not sure how well this will work, but I am going to try on a small area first to see how it goes. If anyone sees any major pitfalls with this plan, please speak up in the comments.</p>
324		<p>It not so much about the rise and run lengths specifically ,but about the ratio of the Rise to Run.  You should strive to hit a 30-35% ration of rise/run.  A 7-11 is the most common and gives you the correct ratio, but any combination of rise to run that hits this 30-35% ratio would be fine.</p>
325		<p>Not sure if it would interfere with the operation of the gates, but if you set that tube into the ground and left a slight lip sticking above the cement, that would probably do a lot to keep stuff out of the hole.</p>

328		<p>I've seen powder concrete colorant on home improvement shows but to be honest I've never used it. The shows I've seen have had great results with it. Looks like you just throw it over wet concrete and let it soak in.</p>
329		<p>Depending on your climate you may need some additional material. My roof has an ice guard on it to keep ice from forming at the edges and backing up underneath the roof. I've also got roofing felt as a barrier between the plywood and shingles.</p>  <p>Roofing shingles are nailed down with galvanized roofing nails (at least mine are) and the little roofing work I've done has used a nailgun to nail the shingles through the roofing felt and plywood. The shingles have a compound on them (may be just plain old tar) that seals around the nail to prevent water from dripping through.</p>  <p>Unless they've come out with new self adhesive shingles you're going to have to nail each course to the roof.</p>

333	Which communication bus systems for home automation?	<p>Many communication systems have been proposed for home automation (e.g., HVAC control, alarms, access control, light control, and entertainment), including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire" rel="nofollow">1-Wire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X10_%28industry_standard%29" rel="nofollow">X10</a>.

334	Do thermostat-controlled, auto-adjust HVAC vents exist?	<p>The residential forced-air HVAC systems I have seen are controlled by a single thermostat in one room.  One has to manually adjust the vents in order to adjust the temperature in other rooms.  Is there such a think as thermostat-controlled, automatically-adjustable vents so that one can have multiple heating/cooling zones without having multiple furnaces and air-conditioners?</p>

337	Should I insulate steam pipes in the basement?	<p>I have a steam-radiator heating system.  The furnace is in the (unfinished) basement, and the steam-carrying steel pipes spread out across the basement ceiling before going up into the rest of the house.  Should I insulate these pipes in order to save energy in the winter?  Or will the furnace itself heat the basement so much that insulating the pipes doesn't matter?</p>

341		<p>Absolutely it's worth insulating.  </p>  <p>Concrete is a poor insulator.  8" concrete blocks have an R-value of 1.1 - about the same as 3/4" particleboard.</p>  <p>In my neck of the woods the frost line is about 3' down. So, assuming that a house here has a 40x40 foot square footprint and the basement is 8' high:</p>  <p>160 lineal feet x 6" = 80 square feet exposed to air; 160 lineal feet x 3' deep = 480 square feet exposed to ground above the frost line; 160 lineal feet x 4.5' deep = 720 square feet exposed to ground below the frost line.</p>  <p>Calculate the heat loss, using the formula (Area * (Tinside - Toutside) / (thermal_resistance) <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/thermo/heatloss.html">See here for a complete explanation</a></p>  <p>Assuming it's 0F outside and 70 inside (you said long and cold :) ), we'll say the above the frost line is 20F and below is 40F.</p>  <p>Above ground: 80*70/1.1 = 5091 BTU/hr Frost line: 480*50/1.1 = 21818 BTU/hr Below Frost line: 720*30/1.1 = 19636 BTU/hr Total: 46545 BTU/hr.</p>  <p>Now sheath and insulate with R20 insulation.  Call it an effective R15 due to thermal bridging by the studs and because you don't do this every day so there are some gaps, etc.  Then your total comes to 3414 BTU/hr.  You save more than 16,000 BTUs/hr, or almost 400,000 BTUs/day.</p>  <p>In a 6 month winter that's 72 million BTUs.  </p>  <p>Your $ savings will depend on the price of energy in your area, what you're heating with etc.  $15/million BTUs is not unusual: that's higher than it was in Alberta where I'm from, but lower than California where I'm at now.</p>
342		<p>Unless you have the tools and knowledge, let the pros handle this one.  I don't think this is really a diy project, there is a reason the installation cost is so high.</p>
343		<p>Insulate the pipes. </p>  <p>You are likely losing a lot of heat into your basement if they aren't insulated. Unless your basement is finished (and therefore you want the heat there) you want to keep as much heat in those pipes as possible so that it gets into the main part of your house.  The heater (and other similar equipment like hot water heater) should heat the room enough to avoid freezing or being a drain on the rest of the house, which is all you really need to worry about.</p>  <p>It can also be safety concern if those pipes are running places where you might inadvertently touch them.</p>

346		<p>Asphalt shingles by themselves will keep out the rain.  Extra steps increase longevity.  You need to follow the manufacturer's directions (take photos!) if the warranty is important to you.</p>  <p>Careful preparation can double the installation time and increase the cost by 25%.  Whether it's worth it to you depends on how catastrophic a leak would be.  For me, my garage or shed gets minimal preparation since a leak doesn't matter that much - it can be patched when it stops raining.  For a house or any finished space like a nice studio, a leak will mean ruined drywall, etc. so more attention is warranted.</p>  <p>In order from minimal work to a complete, nice job:</p>  <ul> <li>Minimum is a double course of shingles at the bottom of the roof.  The bottom course should be upside-down with the tabs cut off.  This is the minimum I'd do, maybe for a shed.</li> <li>Next up is covering the roof with roofing felt before installing the shingles.  This increases the longevity of the shingles and helps the nails hold. I'd do this for a garage.</li> <li>Best, if you're in a cold climate, is covering the roof with roofing felt then adding a 4' course of ice dam, which is a self-adhesive rubber membrane, at the base of the roof.  This helps prevent ice dams from damaging the shingles.  I'd do this on any roof over a finished space.</li> </ul>  <p>The shingles are not self-adhesive, but you'll see strips of tar on the backside.  After you nail the shingles down, the sun will melt these strips and adhere each course of shingles to the one under it.</p>  <p>One thing about the double-course of shingles that you start the roof with. The reason you cut the tabs off and reverse the shingle is to get that strip of tar at the very base of the roof.  The tar will melt and glue the first tabs down, helping prevent the wind from getting under the shingles.  For some reason many people I know, including my father who I worship, will put an upside-down course of shingles first without cutting off the tabs, to save time I guess. To me this is pointless since it does not do its job, which is to lock down the tabs at the leading edge of the roof.</p>
347		<p>My other answer only answered "what should I put under the shingles".  I reread the question and see that @Vebjorn asked how to install shingles.  Doing a shed is a good project if you haven't shingled before.  Doing a house is harder because of the peaks and valleys.</p>  <p>To shingle your shed, assuming a straight gable roof:</p>  <p>A. Roofing felt.</p>  <ol> <li>Buy a roll of roofing felt: you can get that at Home Depot or wherever. </li> <li>Starting at the bottom of the roof, staple down a layer of roofing felt.  Just roll it out, then use a staple gun to fasten it at the top, bottom and middle about every 2 feet along.  </li> <li>After the first layer is put down, add a second layer.  Overlap the first layer by about 6 inches.</li> </ol>  <p>B.  Shingles</p>  <ol> <li>Start with a layer of upside down shingles, with the tabs cut off.  Ask the person at Home Depot for a knife for cutting the shingles - it'll be so dull and gross afterwards you won't want it for anything else.  Position the shingles so the overhang the sides and leading edge of the roof by about 1/2".  Nail the 1/2 shingles with the strip of tar at the base of the roof, putting nails in the shingle 4 across, top and bottom, i.e. eight nails per shingle.</li> <li>Measure the width of the uncut shingle.  Measure that length from bottom of the 1/2 row of shingles on each side of the roof and make a mark.  Snap a chalkline between those marks.</li> <li>Do the first "real" course of shingles.  Again, overhang by about 1/2".  Put 4 nails per shingle, about 1" above the cuts that define the tabs.  Put one nail on each side, and one above each tab cut.  Use the chalkline  to keep them straight.</li> <li>Now the second course.  You want each shingle to be offset by 1/2 tab from the shingles below, and up by 1/2 a shingle width.  On the sides of the shingle are little cuts: bend the top part and that will give you a reference to "butt" against the lower shingle.  That will keep your shingles level.  Likewise, there is a cut on the top of the shingle, in the middle of the tab.  Bend that up on the first row of shingle (already nailed to the roof).  That will give you a place to butt the new shingle side-to-side, to ensure that the new shingle is well placed horizontally.  After the first one is placed you can just butt the shingles against each other, so only the tabs on the new shingle are necessary.</li> <li>When you get to the end, cut off the flap as best you can straight with the line you want. Then go back and do the gap at the beginning: you can often use the cutoff from the end you finished to fill in the end you started.  (It probably wasn't clear in (4), but I like to start with a full shingle, then come back and fill in the bit at the beginning of the course).</li> <li>Continue until you get to the top.  The last shingle should fold over to the other side.  Then do the other side.</li> </ol>  <p>C.  The peak</p>  <ol> <li>Now you have two sides of shingles folded over.  You need to finish the peak.</li> <li>Cut a shingle into three tabs, cutting up-and-down at the tab slot.</li> <li>Turn a tab sideways, and fold it over the peak at one edge of the building. Choose the edge away from the prevailing wind.  It should be half-and-half on each side.  </li> <li>Measure how far down the peak it goes, the mark the same distance from the peak on the other side.  Snap a chalk line.</li> <li>Continue to nail tabs (1/3 shingles) along the peak, two nails per tab, using the chalkline to line them up.  You won't have the tabs to help you with the offset now, but by now your eye will be pretty good. :)</li> <li>Finish up with a 1/2 tab.  Tar the exposed nails.</li> </ol>

349	How can I fix a screen door that sticks?	<p>I have a sliding screen door that leads out to a porch/deck.  The door continually sticks and is just doesn't slide open cleanly.

350	What's the best/easiest way to paint edges?	<p>Been doing a lot of interior painting lately and I always find the edges&nbsp;â by the ceiling, windows, baseboards, etc.&nbsp;â the most tedious.  </p>  <p>What's the best way to paint the edges&nbsp;â old fashioned cut brush?  Some of these special edging tools they have at all the home stores?  Some other method?</p>
351		<p>I've used the <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_03076047000P?vName=Tools&amp;cName=Painting&amp;Supplies&amp;sName=Paint%20Brushes,%20Rollers%20&amp;%20Accessories&amp;sid=IDx20070921x00003a&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=03076047000P" rel="nofollow">Shur-Line Paint Edger</a> with some success -- mostly against the ceiling, though. Some tips for using it:</p>  <ul> <li>Don't get overzealous and load tons of paint on it - it will just overflow onto the spacer wheels and track nicely spaced marks across your ceiling.</li> <li>Another side effect of too much paint is a raised bead of paint on the wall beneath the edger that you will have to feather out, unless you want a uniform ridge running around the room 4" from the ceiling</li> </ul>  <p>I gave up on the corner edger that Shur-Line makes and went with a brush for the corners. The corner edger either didn't cover the spot I brushed it over, or left a bead of paint to each side that I'd have to go over with a brush anyway.</p>  <p>For window frames and baseboards, I ended up using blue painter's tape and a brush. Careful with how long you leave the tape on though, since it can pull up paint that's underneath it. I wouldn't recommend using blue painter's tape for anything but trim, which usually has a high-gloss or a semi-gloss finish, making it so the tape doesn't stick as well.</p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After painting the bedrooms of our house with the Shur-Line Edger, I moved on to using a 2" angled brush for the rest of the house. It took some getting used to, but I could actually do it faster than with the edger by the time we were through.</p>

353		<p>Depending on the size of the cracks an asphalt sealant should close things up and protect the driveway. If the cracks are large you might have to get some asphalt patch and then seal it. your local home improvement store should have asphalt sealant and may have asphalt patch available.</p>  <p>Asphalt sealant is pretty messy stuff though, best to wear throw away clothes and boots.</p>
354	How can I repair a pothole on the edge of an asphalt driveway?	<p>I have a large pothole in my asphalt driveway that extends to the edge. I'm considering repairing it with cold patch blacktop, but I'm uncertain of how to deal with the edge. Do I need to add a 2x4 form, or is there a different product I should use?</p>
355		<p>Depends on what's at the edge of your driveway? is it grass? then you might want to brace with a 2x4 against the ground just to keep the edge nice. If you don't want to dig up the ground to put a 2x4 in the ground you could probably get away with a thinner piece of wood.</p>
356		<p>It seems that X10 is simplest solution if applicable, because it relies on existing electrical lines. Beside 1-Wire, protocols like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-485" rel="nofollow">RS-485</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" rel="nofollow">CAN bus</a> are also good option because they work well on large distances (tens or even hundreds of meters). Protocols like i2c or spi, are usually reserved for shorter distances (few meters) and are useful for say sensor to micro controller communication.</p>

358	How can I tell if wood is properly dried?	<p>I guess measuring it's weight would be one of the answers, but it doesn't seem practical because wood of a same type can probably fluctuate  in it's density enough to make measurement unreliable in 10-20% moisture range. Are there any specific tips for wood like ash, beech or oak?</p>
359		<p>I've been very unsatisfied with X10-based automation systems. I've installed a bit of it in my home, and find them flakey. <a href="http://www.smarthome.com" rel="nofollow">Smarthome's</a> <a href="http://www.insteon.net/" rel="nofollow">Insteon</a> is a combo powerline/RF system that at least should be less flakey than X10. This is what I will probably try next myself, since it's backwards compatible with X10 and fairly inexpensive.</p>  <p>Beyond that, there are Z-wave systems like Leviton's Vezia RF+ which look pretty interesting, but they're pricy. And I hear people say great things about UPB products, but again, they cost about twice what Insteon goes for and are powerline only. In my house, I think an RF component is a good idea because each half of my house is on a separate electrical box. Insteon also makes every component a repeater, which is helpful in my house again because there are some walls filled with concrete. For me, anything that can repeat a signal is a good thing (at least I hope).</p>  <p>One complaint (~2006-2007) with Insteon was reliability of the devices themselves, but I understand that this has improved.</p>  <p>My experience researching home automation is that you can get excellent solutions by spending a very large amount of money (tens of thousands of dollars). For reasonable money, there's no one great answer, but there are answers that work pretty well. My suggestion is to build out slowly so you don't sink too much money into a single solution before finding out what really works in your house.</p>
360		<p>You could do something with trunking on the surface - either put in skirting with built-in trunking or try to find some trunking that matches your skirting and put it just above... Then run all your cables through that.</p>

362		<p>I've had success with this <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_03012116000P?vName=Tools&amp;cName=Painting&amp;Supplies&amp;sName=Paint%20Brushes,%20Rollers%20&amp;%20Accessories&amp;sid=IDx20070921x00003a&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=03012116000P" rel="nofollow">Paint Edger</a> it's nice because it has little tabs that flip up when you put paint on the pad, and then flip back down to glide along trim or the ceiling.  Because the tabs flip up it is less likely you will get paint on them, which makes it less likely you will get paint where you don't want it.</p>  <p>But I still don't think there is any substitute for a steady hand, and patience. </p>
363		<p>A good old fashioned, quality paint brush.  </p>  <p>Get a good quality paint brush and take good care of it.  It's a lot less time intensive to use a good brush and make a good line than it is to have to tape it first.  </p>

Is the airflow at the vents good?</p>  <p>After he added coolant, is the system working better?  If yes, the system was low on charge.  If not, something else is wrong.</p>  <p>It is possible for the system to be low on charge, but still be able to keep up on days that are moderate (albeit at a lower efficiency than a properly charged system).</p>  <p>It is also possible for there to be a leak, but the HVAC guy missed it.  He probably only did a quick leak check (soap bubbles).  There are more involved (expensive) tests he can do.  However, they may not be necessary.  If adding coolant made the system work well, wait and see.  If the performance degrades again in a few weeks/months, you have a leak.</p>  <p>If there is a leak, it is usually in the outdoor unit, which is exposed to the elements, and takes a beating.</p>  <p>The good news is that the unit is probably still under parts warranty (typically 5 years for a cheap unit, 10 years for a good one), so if there is something expensive wrong, the parts should be covered.</p>  <p>(When was the last time your air filter was replaced?  If it's been more than 6mo, look at it and see if it is OK.  Replace if necessary.  If you aren't up for replacing your air filter at least once a year, you should consider a service contract where the techs do it for you.)</p>
367		<p>Your best bet is to get a moisture meter, like this one: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006OC3FK" rel="nofollow">Amazon link to one meter</a>.  Moisture meters come various ranges: you want one that measures in the 6-14% range or so.  Anything above 14% is not useful for woodworking as it will shrink too much.</p>  <p>Meters come in two varieties, pinned and pinless.  The pinned meters measure stick two electrodes into the wood about 1/4" and measure the electrical resistance.  You tell the meter what species you're measuring, and it uses an internal table to tell you the moisture content.</p>  <p>The pinless variety won't mar your wood, but they're quite a bit more expensive.  They use induction or ESP or fairy dust or something to read the moisture level.</p>  <p>If your wallet is glued shut, you can use weight to measure the moisture content.  <a href="http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Measuring_MC_by_weight.html" rel="nofollow">Have a look here.</a></p>
368		<p>Call a professional.  </p>  <p>I'm not sure there are really any diy ways to handle asbestos.  In most places you need a license, and lots of expensive equipment to remove asbestos.  You might be able to find somebody in your area willing to come out and take a look for free, if you are really lucky and they are really nice (or really hard up for work) they might even test it for free.  The removal will most likely be a bit costly though. </p>
369		<p>Asking which bus to use is the wrong question here. What you should be telling us is what you want to do, and then the technology to do that will follow.</p>  <p>One problem I've found is that to get the best stuff, you have to mix and match technology. For example, Insteon, Z-Wave, and UBP are all leading for lighting/power control, but if you insist your security system has to use the same technology, you're going to have to pick from the best of the security systems that use that bus, not from the one that best meets all your actual security system needs. </p>  <p>The nice thing is though, there are a lot of both hardware controllers and software out there that can integrate various things together, so even if your actual security sensors are hardwired and/or some proprietary wireless protocol, you can still likely get at the least alarm conditions and at best full status/arm/dearm control onto your lighting network using addd-on products designed for that.</p>
370		<p>Sounds like your compressor is dying.  You are probably on borrowed time.  Hard to say how long it will last, because it depends on how much the unit is running (depends on climate).</p>  <p>A total lifespan of 15 years is reasonable for a unit before major repairs are required.</p>  <p>Note that newer systems are usually far more efficient (SEER and EER ratings).  And so they can pay for themselves pretty quickly.  Especially with the tax credits that are available now.</p>
371		<p>There are two ways to do it:</p>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Use CO/ALR switches/receptacles</strong>: these are specifically designed for aluminum wire. They have "CO/ALR" stamped on them somewhere. When you connect the wire, use a paste like <a href="http://www.idealindustries.com/prodDetail.do?prodId=noalox&amp;div=5&amp;l1=accessories" rel="nofollow">Noalox</a> (box stores sell it). </p></li> <li><p><strong>Use a pigtail connection</strong>: Sometimes it is not possible to find CO/ALR switches with the function or style you need. You can use a copper wire to connect to the switch itself as usual, and then a <strong>#63 wire connector</strong> to connect the copper wire to the aluminum one. Here is a picture of a 3-way dimmer switch I installed using this method:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P5Do1.png" alt="alt text"> (apologies for fuzzy picture) </p>  <p>Note that you do the same thing with switches that have wires coming out of them already (like most dimmer switches do) or any other fixtures. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/BvDZ4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p></li> </ul>  <hr>  <p>To quote from the ESA (Ontario Electrical Safety Authority)'s <a href="http://www.esasafe.com/assets/files/esasafe/pdf/Flash_Notices/09-08-FL.pdf" rel="nofollow">Notice on Aluminum wiring in residential installations</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Even though not required by the Code, it is   recommended that bare ends of solid aluminum conductors be coated with approved joint compound.</p>      <p>...</p>      <ul>   <li>The Ontario Electrical Safety Code permits the installation of aluminum wiring.</li>   <li>Adequate precautions shall be given to the terminations and splicing of aluminum conductors; </li>   <li>Aluminum wiring itself is safe if proper connections and terminations are made, without damaging   the wire and devices approved for use with aluminum wire are employed.</li>   <li>Aluminum wiring is widely used today for larger commercial and industrial feeders. Electrical distribution companies use it widely throughout their distribution systems including the supply service cable to most residences; in fact it may still be used today for interior wiring systems in   residential homes as well as other structures. </li>   </ul>      <p>...</p>      <p><strong>Aluminum wiring itself is safe and if proper connections and terminations are made without damaging the wire and using approved materials installed in accordance with the Ontario Electrical Safety Code and the manufacturerâs instructions, there should be no problems with the aluminum wiring installation.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <hr>  <p>In either case:</p>  <ul> <li>Connect with #63 wire connectors.</li> <li>Use the anti-oxidant paste on the wire and any other connections involving aluminum (apply to the wires before you screw on the connector). </li> <li>Use a wire brush to remove any oxidation before applying paste and making the connection </li> </ul>
373		<p>Another way to do this which is definitely easier if you're retro-fitting is to use smart switches, such as <a href="http://www.insteon.net/dimmers.html" rel="nofollow">Insteon</a> or <a href="http://www.simply-automated.com/products/items/US11-40_single_rocker_dimmer_controller.php" rel="nofollow">UPB</a> switches (there are others as well, including the older X10-based products). These will allow you to connect one of these switches to the load being controlled, and then have other switches remotely control that switch (they communicate with each other either over the power lines in your house, or wirelessly). </p>  <p>The benefit is you don't have to run any new wiring. You can also add keypad controllers and remotes, and start having a single keypad that controls multiple lights at once, all with different levels of brightness and ramp rates (fade speeds).</p>
374		<ul> <li>Make sure you clean the joint very well (with a stiff bristle brush) making sure you remove all dust and debris from the crack.</li> <li>Mix up some mortar and put it in something similar to a pastry bag (the thing bakers use to decorate with). A large Zip-Lock bag with a nipped corner should work.</li> <li>Squeeze the bag so the mortar fills the gap making sure the mortar goes as deep as possible.</li> <li>Wipe off any excess mortar.</li> <li>Wait for the mortar to dry slightly and then tool the joint to match existing joints.</li> </ul>
375		<p>If you can remove one panel carefully you might find the manufacturer stamp on the back. It will narrow down the search down a little bit. Otherwise just a small sample would be nice to have when visit the stores. I've seen websites on the web that identify manufactures based on the sample that you send. Both Lowe's and Home Depot sell some vynil siding. Not a huge selection.</p>  <p>Honestly, it doesn't have to be exactly the same. The previous owner used a similar siding on the addition and i didn't notice until i had to replace a panel.</p>
377		<p><strong>Utility Knife</strong></p>  <p>For about $10-15 USD you can get 100 utility knife blades, so you don't have to worry about sharpening your knife/breaking the blade (except your eyes of course!).</p>  <p>I use mine for all sorts of stuff.</p>
378		<p><strong>A <em>Good</em> Multi-tool</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/GFQlQ.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>My personal favourite tool was my Gerber - though I know some people also like/prefer Leathermans. This is one thing where going cheap is <em>not</em> worth it. Anything Gerber, -Leatherman, -SOG, or any other <em>quality</em> tool brand really shines when compared with a cheap $10 variety. Seriously - save up for a few months and buy a good one. You'll be <em>very</em> glad you did.</p>  <p>I used mine almost daily until I lost it :'(</p>  <p>I'm saving up for a new one :D</p>
382		<ul> <li>Check if the wall is <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/4/methods-to-determine-if-a-wall-is-load-bearing">load-bearing</a> <ul> <li>See that link for how to do this. </li> </ul></li> <li>Try to see if there are are any high-voltage lines in the wall  <ul> <li>Look for light switches, receptacles, lights, hard-wired smoke detector </li> <li>In some cases, a wire may run though the wall, but not be visible. This is very hard to determine, and takes sleuth work (look for wires entering the wall from floors above/below, and consider based on locations of other electrical if it's likely this wall is used to run wires). There are voltage detectors that MAY be able to detect the lines, but not guaranteed (though if they indicate, you know there's a line there for sure).</li> </ul></li> <li>Check for low-voltage lines as well (cable, phone, internet, doorbell, HVAC, speakers).  <ul> <li>These are probably even harder to find than high-voltage lines unless there is something on the wall that gives it away. Accidentally cutting one of these is a pain, but not nearly as dangerous or life-threatening as a high-voltage line. </li> </ul></li> <li>Check for plumbing  <ul> <li>This can include hot/cold water, waste lines and vent lines. </li> <li>Waste plumbing works on gravity, and so it will usually take the shortest route. Find bathrooms/sinks and the main waste lines in the house, and see if this wall falls between them.</li> <li>Supply plumbing is hard to detect unless there is a fixture on the wall. Requires some sleuth work. </li> </ul></li> <li>Check for air ducts  <ul> <li>Relatively easy to determine: if there is a vent on the wall or you can see duct work connecting to it (cavities inside walls are often used as vertical ducts)</li> <li>Can be a bit harder to find if it's used as a riser to connect horizontal runs between two floors. If it's above/below the main duct run then it's possible. </li> <li>If you remove a wall without re-running vents, you may be cutting off the supply or return to an area of your house, which can reduce air quality and comfort.</li> </ul></li> <li>Central vac pipes <ul> <li>Generally the rule is to try and avoid as many turns as possible, and avoid going up towards the vacuum. Same idea as finding waste lines: find the vacuum and the wall ports, and if this wall is in the most direct path between them it's likely to have lines. You may also be able to hear them, especially if you put your ear against the wall and have someone suck up a small pebble or something noisy (but that won't damage the vacuum). </li> </ul></li> <li>Gas lines <ul> <li>Pretty unlikely to find gas running through the middle of a wall (especially one you're considering tearing out) but it's still a possibility.</li> <li>Again, if the wall is the most direct route between the gas source, and the appliance (consider: water heaters, furnace, oven, BBQ), it's possible </li> </ul></li> <li>In a commercial structure, the wall may be a fire wall (there will be doors on auto-closers separating this area from all others if this is the case - though check with your local fire department or building inspector). </li> </ul>  <p>Of course, even if you are fairly confident there is nothing in the wall, don't just pull out the sawzall and tear through it - put some holes in it first to visually inspect for anything you might have missed. Most people will take all the drywall off at least one side before touching studs, as it gives that total check that everything is good to go. </p>
383		<p>Tankless heaters are rated by the amount they raise the temperature of the water at a specific flow rate (and as the flow goes higher, the amount they raise the temperature is lower), for example:</p>  <pre><code>Rise in Temp:    50Â°F      75Â°F     100Â°F Flow rate:    3.8 gpm   2.4 gpm   1.9 gpm </code></pre>  <p>Basically, the lower your incoming water temperature, the larger a unit you need to get. Sizing is also dependent on the number and types of simultaneous consumers of hot water (eg, being able to run two showers at once requires a larger size than is needed for just a kitchen sink). </p>  <p><a href="http://www.gotankless.com/tankless-model-selector.html">This manufacturer site</a> shows incoming temperatures in North America, and helps provide sizing information based on their models.</p>  <p>Anecdotaly, I know virtually all new construction I've seen around Ontario for the past couple years (including <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=ottawa,+ontario&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Ottawa,+Ottawa+Division,+Ontario&amp;gl=ca&amp;ei=IzNJTP3BJcalnQfex9TjDQ&amp;ved=0CCUQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=45.413876,-75.695801&amp;spn=12.199543,33.815918&amp;t=h&amp;z=6">Ottawa</a>, Ontario) uses tankless heaters.</p>  <p>Resource: <a href="http://www.tanklesswaterheaterguide.com/">http://www.tanklesswaterheaterguide.com/</a> </p>

386		<p>I do it with just a 3-inch brush (Wooster).  Get a small bead/line of paint on one side of the brush and then wipe the other side clean on the paint tray.  Then pull the brush along the edge as straight as possible.  </p>  <p>One thing I have learned is that when you are up on a ladder with your face a couple of inches from the spot you are painting, the newly painted edge will never look perfect.  But trying to make it perfect will just make it worse.  Pull the edge out once (as straight as you can) and then move on... you'll find that when you are down off the ladder it will look pretty good.</p>
387		<p>Safety glasses and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013A0C0Y?tag=jeffwids02-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0013A0C0Y&amp;adid=0GDD9J5191WADW8VSHDQ&amp;">ear plugs</a> (and work gloves too).  </p>  <p>Get a good pair of safety glasses so they are comfortable, won't fog up, and do not scratch easily and then take good care of them (just like they are regular glasses).  Wearing safety glasses when you are working below anything is huge to not only protect your eyes but also just make it so much easier to do the work.  If you are working outside then get the sunglass ones (they can double as just regular sunglasses too - I leave them in my car).</p>  <p>Buy a package of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013A0C0Y?tag=jeffwids02-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0013A0C0Y&amp;adid=0GDD9J5191WADW8VSHDQ&amp;">foam ear plugs</a>... and use them all the time.  This is the other item that is huge to protect your hearing but then also make it much much more comfortable to do whatever loud do-it-yourself job you are working on.  You will notice a big difference between your stamina when wearing the ear plugs.  For instance, if you are pounding in nails, with the ear plugs in you won't notice the sound, but without them, the constant high pitched noise takes a toll on your ears (and wears you out for the job faster).  (They also are great for just blocking out noise to let you concentrate.)</p>  <p>The other basic safety equipment is work gloves.  </p>

389	What are some pros, cons and recommendations for multicables?	<p>Currently saving to build a new home and I'm going over wiring options in my mind. My current home has too few sockets, cable connections and LAN ports (yes I still like wired LAN, wireless is good but wired is faster).</p>  <p>I'd like to solicit some recommendations for pros and cons of multicables (I.E. cables that have power, telephone, network, and TV cable all bundled into one). Has anyone used a multicable bundle and if so, what are the ups and downs of them?</p>  <p>I'd also like to get some good recommendations of a brand to use. Cables and wall plates if you have come across them before.</p>
391		<p>I would not recommend these.  I researched them a few years ago when building and opted to just do them all individually.  Coax (Quad shield RG6), cat 5e, cat 3, and speaker wire.  It was actually more cost effective to buy them all in 500-1000' spools individually, than to buy a lot of multicable.  Plus, the interference can be an issue.  You could combine the phone and network use cat 5/6 for the phones, but again, it was more cost effective to buy them separately.</p>
392	How do I fix a squeaky floor below my carpet?	<p>I have a squealy floor below my carpet on the 2nd floor of my house.  It sounds like the subfloor under the carpet is moving up and down a little and makes this awful load squeak when I step down on this specific location.  It can be reproduced at will.</p>
393		<p>Fixing a squeaky floor beneath a carpet is a fairly complicated process that's probably best illustrated with video. <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/video/0,,20045284,00.html">This Old House provides a wonderful tutorial.</a></p>  <p>The procedure demonstrated at that link does not require you to pull up any carpet and uses scored screws to hide your work. This seems to be the most hassle-free way to do what one might expect to be a huge job.</p>
394		<p>If there's movement you'd do best to pull back the carpet and nail down the subfloor. Hopefully the squeak isn't in the middle of the room.</p>  <p>I had a squeaky floor at an old house, had to pull back a large chunk of carpet and drive a few nails through the floor to anchor it down.</p>  <p>Best of luck.</p>

397	What type of block should I use for a small retaining wall?	<p>I am just starting on a new project to build a small 10 x 10 patio in the front of my house.  The 10 x 10 area is not level with the front left corner sloping down about 8 to 10 inches compared to the back half which is mostly level.  </p>  <p>I am assuming I would build a small retaining wall to build up the front by that 8 to 10 inches.

399		<p>Other people have already answered this one pretty well.  I just wanted to add one thing.  While you are replacing the outlets, it might be a good idea to use <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/99.html" rel="nofollow">GFCI receptacles</a> where appropriate.</p>  <p>GFCIs should be used wherever stuff that is plugged into it could be exposed to water.  (Outlets that are near kitchen/bathroom sinks, outdoor outlets, outlets that are right under a water line, etc).</p>
400		<p>The PO did it in my house, but we have a well. He insulated the cold-water pex wherever he could, probably because it sits in a pressure tank and he was hoping it would stay cold.</p>  <p>When you touch the cold and hot copper, you can feel cold and hot which means the heat transfer for copper tubing is efficient. (should insulate)</p>  <p>Grab your pex and see what you can feel.</p>

402	Cause of eroded mortar in exterior brick	<p>This <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/365/should-i-fill-eroded-mortar-in-exterior-brick" rel="nofollow">question</a> actually reminded me of an issue with my exterior walls. I have the same problem with the vertical mortar being eroded/missing from several bricks at ground level on the exterior of my house. I live in Alabama, so we don't have much severe weather (unless you count ridiculous humidity), and I have no idea how this could have happened. The rest of the mortar is fine, but only a few joints are completely missing. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? Is this some purposefully built structural feature that I'm just oblivious toward - they seem to be fairly regularly spaced.</p>  <p>When the home inspector came by before we bought the house, he didn't mention anything about them, and I didn't really notice them until we moved in.</p>

404	How can I improve the water pressure in my shower?	<p>I recently purchased my first home. It has two bathrooms and the water pressure in both is less than ideal. What are some steps I can take to increase the pressure?</p>
405		<p>This is an effective trick a plumbing contractor once told me.</p>  <p>Go to your local home improvement store and buy a cheap shower head (the one I picked up cost $1.50). If you look down inside of the showerhead you'll see a washer which constricts the water flow. If you take a drill and enlarge the hole, thereby increasing flow, the water pressure will increase. I didn't think it would work but it did!!</p>  <p>If you want to go the expensive route, there are pumps you can purchase that will attach to the piping and add pressure to the water. I've heard of such a thing but never looked for one.</p>
406		<p>Is it the water pressure for the whole bathroom, or just the shower that's sub-par? Before I bought a house, my last apartment had really poor pressure in the shower, but the bathtub faucet was fine. I removed the shower head to see if that was the cause, and sure enough, there was plenty of water pressure in the shower, it was just the cheapo shower head that the apartment had installed. I bought a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000GLO0L8" rel="nofollow">Waterpik</a> and it solved everything.</p>
407		<p>Use a light bulb.  Besides being more than capable of dissipating the power, it has the bonus of telling you when the capacitor is empty since the light will go out.</p>  <p>The best way is to use a spare light socket and touch the two wires to the capacitor leads. Lacking a socket, some wire and electrical tape will do the trick if you're careful.</p>

409		<p>Is it the bottom row of bricks, and are they regularly spaced? (I guess that's only possible if your foundation comes up 40cm.)  Because if that's the case, they're weep holes, and shouldn't be filled in. Otherwise, I'd go with @Tester101's answer.</p>
410		<p>Low pressure can be caused by old galvanized pipe, which often build up deposits causing the water to be restricted.  </p>  <p>Another cause of low pressure can be incorrect pipe size. I like to run a 3/4" trunk line with 1/2" legs to fixtures (which I think is pretty common).</p>  <p>Some houses have pressure reducing valves on the supply line, which are used to control the water pressure inside the house. Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDxx_od_LL0">a video</a> explaining how to adjust this valve. </p>  <ol> <li>Start by loosening the lock nut.<br> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/mM6gNm.png" alt="enter image description here"> </li> <li>Next turn the adjustment screw. <ul> <li>Turn the screw Clockwise to increase the pressure.</li> <li>Turn the screw Anticlockwise to decrease the pressure.<br> <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LXNqwm.png" alt="enter image description here"></li> </ul></li> <li>Once the proper pressure is set, tighten the lock nut.</li> </ol>  <p>These answers all assume the pressure is low in the whole house. If it's just the shower see the other answers.</p>
411		<p>It really depends mostly on the look you are going for, any kind of retaining wall blocks should work fine.  The most important thing is making sure that you put down a good foundation for the bottom row of blocks.  </p>  <p>Make sure to trench it out a bit, put some gravel in the bottom of the trench and sand on top of that for good drainage and to prevent frost heave (if you have frost in your area).  Level it out nice and put down the first row of blocks.  Once you have that down, the rest is easy.</p>
413	What's the minimum recommended compressor HP/PSI to spray paint?	<p>I have a little compressor that I use for a small brad nailer and blowing up tires. Is there a minimum PSI or horsepower that I need to be able to get to in order to spray paint with it?</p>
414		<p>not 100% certain on this, but a double vapor barrier will actually cause harm as the moisture will have no where to escape to.  Especially if you place it on the non-faced side.  If you place it on the already faced side, it probably wont hurt, but is pointless as you already have the barrier .</p>
415		<p>The spray gun should have a min/max PSI rating on it (or in the manual), if your compressor can go that high you're good to go. Although if it's a small compressor it's going to be running quite a bit to keep up with the expended air from a paint gun and you may run into trouble if you don't have enough pressure.</p>
416		<p>In the U.S., shower heads are required by government regulation to restrict water flow in order to save water and energy. By law, they must deliver less than 2.5 gallons per minute. For this reason, many shower heads will deliver less than ideal flow and/or pressure. To get around the law, and benefit those with less-than-stellar water pressure, many showerheads (e.g., the Waterpik I recently bought) come with instructions for removing the flow regulator. If you've discarded those instructions, a quick Google search should be all you need to figure out how to remove the flow regulator in your shower head.</p>
417		<p>Paint sprayers have a pretty low PSI requirement.  I'd be more concerned about the CFM (Cubic feet per minute) rating of your compressor.  That would indicate whether it can compress the air fast enough to keep up with the sprayer. </p>
418		<p>I've removed all the wallpaper from our house. In the three bedrooms, it was painted over. I think I've seen the gamut of wallpaper removal.</p>  <p><strong>Easy</strong> Wallpaper just stripped off in nice sheets. This was in the dining room. It wasn't painted over. It took Maybe 15 minutes to do a 14' x 10' room.  </p>  <p><strong>Hard</strong> This is the technique we used for two of the bedrooms where the wallpaper had been painted over. Messier, much more work, but the only option.</p>  <ol> <li>Perforate wall paper with <a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=949113&amp;Ntt=949113&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;recN=118502&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber" rel="nofollow">wallpaper perforation tool</a> </li> <li>Apply steam using steamer</li> <li>Scrape off paper with <a href="http://www.stanleytools.com/default.asp?CATEGORY=PUTTY+KNIVES&amp;TYPE=PRODUCT&amp;PARTNUMBER=28-244&amp;SDesc=4%26%2334;+Plastic+Handle+Joint+Knife" rel="nofollow">4" putty knife</a></li> </ol>  <p><strong>Extreme</strong> The last bedroom we did, I came close to giving up and resorting to either tearing out the drywall or some other extreme measure. We tried everything, in the end it took 6 nights of work to do a small (10' x 10') bedroom. The paper was very, very stuck on and then painted over.</p>  <p>The steamer could not soften up the underlying glue layer because of the paint, even with very liberal perforation. If you held the steamer on long enough to get the paper off it had already softened up the underlying drywall and you'd very easily gouge the drywall and remove paint/backing.</p>  <p>So we resolved to first scraping off the top layer of paint exposing just the wallpaper backing and then using the normal technique for wallpaper removal with just the backing.</p>  <p><em>(I will have to check my notes, as I don't think this is quite the exact steps yet.)</em></p>  <ol> <li>Perforate wall paper with <a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=949113&amp;Ntt=949113&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;recN=118502&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber" rel="nofollow">wallpaper perforation tool</a></li> <li>Use a sharp scraper (we found <a href="http://www.rona.ca/shop/~scraper-wallpaper-scraper-richard-54883_!scraper_shop" rel="nofollow">this one worked best</a>) to remove the top layer of paint.</li> <li>Working one 3' x 3' section at a time, apply steam, scrape off using <a href="http://media.wiley.com/Lux/33/82633.image0.jpg" rel="nofollow">paper scraper</a></li> </ol>
420	What are some ways to wire rear speakers in a home theater system?	<p>I have two rear speakers, that I never use, since I don't have a good way (yet) to wire them.<br> I have a hardwood floor. And the side of the room that is nearest to the TV+Audio source is open. So I don't have a wall to run the cable next to it.  </p>
421	What type of regular maintenance should I be doing on my central air conditioning unit?	<p>I have not done any maintenance on my central air conditioning system since I bought my house five years ago.  Everything seems to be running fine but is there some sort of maintenance I should be doing regularly?  </p>
422		<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EJ332O?tag=jeffwids02-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B000EJ332O&amp;adid=1PVY11N0KKTTVD17ECXC&amp;">Non-Contact Voltage Tester</a>.<br> This comes in very handy to make sure you turned off the correct circuit breaker before doing any electrical work.  And really helps if you have some funky wiring in your house and not everything in a single box is on the same circuit.</p>  <p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/2149063ZRQL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Non-Contact Voltage Tester"></p>
423		<p>Every year or two I call out a professional company to check the coolant levels and check for any mechanical defects since I don't have all the gear to do it myself.</p>  <p>Aside from that I just try and keep the area free of debris and anything that could damage the unit. In my case I have a tree off to the side and several branches hang over the unit which I trim back, don't want a branch falling off and spearing through the unit.</p>
424		<p>Have you thought about using in-ceiling speakers?  Then you could fish the wires through the ceiling (assuming the joists run the right way or you have access to the attic).</p>
425		<p>Most local HVAC service companies offer an annual service plan where they come out once a year (twice a year for a heat pump), check over everything in the system (indoor and outdoor), clean off the coils, replace the air filters, etc.  They will measure the voltage and resistance of various electrical components in the system, as well as measure the temperature of the coils to see if anything is out of whack.</p>  <p>If you have a service contract, there really isn't anything else you need to do for maintenance except make sure the outdoor unit isn't overgrown with grass/leaves/whatever.</p>  <p>Around here, a service contract for a heat pump (2 visits per year) runs $150-$200 per year.  I think it's in the sub-$100 range for just an A/C unit, since they don't have to care about both heating and cooling.</p>  <p>I also have a humidifier plumbed into the HVAC system with a moisture pad that has to be replaced annually.  Replacing the moisture pad is covered as part of the my service contract (as well as the air filter).</p>  <p>Most of the HVAC companies around here will also give you a small discount on repairs if you have a contract with them (call you a "Preferred Customer").</p>
426		<p>If you have well water, the pressure in the holding tank may not be correct.  The cut in and cut out pressures may need to be calibrated.</p>
427		<p>If you're installing in room where you can't drop above or below the room to run your cables, consider putting up crown molding -- it typically leaves a small channel behind it which is ideal for hiding speaker cables.</p>  <p>You can then punch holes in the top of the wall where you need to run vertically, fish the wires through, staple it up into the corner, then install the crown molding to hide everything.</p>  <p>You can also go the low route, and hide them behind your baseboards, but there isn't always a void behind them, so this could get a little messier if you have to trim away drywall (or plaster in older homes) to create a channel you can use.  You also have problems with baseboards if you have to go past any doorways.</p>
428		<p>There are various degrees of a "zoned" HVAC system.</p>  <p>A simple zoned system will include motorized dampers in the ducts to direct air where it is needed.  e.g. If one room is too cold, but the other ones are fine, the system will shut the dampers to the other rooms, and then fire up the heater so just the one room is heated.</p>  <p>More sophisticated zoning systems for larger house will include multiple heating/cooling units (e.g. one for the upstairs and one for the downstairs).</p>  <p>Zoned systems can also work on a schedule.  (e.g. keep the downstairs of your house comfortable during the day, but direct all of the airflow upstairs at night.)</p>  <p>As you can imagine, the control systems for such a unit get pretty complex.  Motorized dampers everywhere, control lines to all the dampers, thermostats in the various rooms.  It all adds up to a lot of money.  It is also a lot of stuff that can break.</p>  <p>Because of the complexity, most HVAC contractors will avoid doing a zoned system unless absolutely necessary.  It is usually easier to install a big air handler (enough CFM to cover the whole house), and then put a few manual dampers (1/10th the cost of motorized ones) and tweak them until they are right.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Another option to consider is a <a href="http://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/en/consumer/product-solutions/product-showcase" rel="nofollow">multi-split system</a>.  Instead of having all your ducts connected back to one central air handler unit, each room/area has its own indoor unit, with its own fan and thermostat.  All of the indoor units have refrigerant lines that are connected to the outdoor condenser unit.  Each unit can heat/cool independently.  Some systems even allow simultaneous heating and cooling (good for server rooms in an office building).  Because they are ductless, they are a good fit for retrofitting a house with no ducts.  They do not make a lot of sense in an existing house that is already ducted, though.</p>
430		<p>Like Eric said, CFM is the important thing, and most small compressors have a <em>low</em> (&lt; 1 CFM @ 45 PSI) output. For doing anything besides light airbrushing (and I mean the artistic kind), you definitely want something with a greater output. In addition, most paint sprayers will tell you what their consumption is, i.e. 1 CFM @ 45 PSI or 2 CFM @ 90 PSI or something like that. It really depends on the airgun because you have HVLP (High Volume, Low Pressure), HVHP, and LVLP (those are rare). But they'll have a sticker or marking of some sort to tell you what they need.</p>  <p>For painting, you really can't use a smaller compressor, you'll need a larger one, probably at least 15 gallons (they tend to have a large enough motor). Just match up the paint gun to the compressor.</p>
431	What is the best way to remove popcorn from the ceiling?	<p>What is the best solution for removing popcorn from the ceiling if I want to get it to look smooth afterwards?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong>: thanks for your answers!  Would you estimate that replacing the drywall on the ceiling would be less work/mess and result in a better finish?</p>
432		<p>Many, many things. </p>  <p>First up, voltage. For historical reasons just about every domestic installation in the UK uses the same European standard voltage of 230V for every socket. In turn, almost all sockets used indoors are the same size and shape and deliver the same maximum current. (Some farms have three-phase 415V supply, but  I don't think that's often run to the house itself...!) </p>  <p>Just in itself that introduces a whole level of complexity as the higher voltage is much keener on using a human being to find its way to earth. </p>  <p>Secondly, current. UK domestic power sockets are all rated at 13A, whereas in the US there's typically different sockets for different kinds of jobs. However, these sockets are joined in a "ring main" which is typically rated at 32A in total for all the sockets on the ring: so in theory connecting live and neutral on a ring main can deliver 230V * 32A = 7.3kW. </p>  <p>Makes for a nice bang. So it's wise to be careful.</p>  <p>Power in the UK is distributed from the supply company's meter to a "consumer unit" (these days, RCDs and circuit breakers) from whence the ring mains for sockets, lights and heavy equipment are powered. Like sockets, breakers are double-pole. The power company generally only provides a single-phase supply from their meter, it's an offence to tinker with anything upstream of that.</p>  <p>Earth is typically a ground spike combined with a connection to the water main (if it's metal) or the gas main. Separate earth runs need to be made to exposed metal fixtures such as basins or bathtubs. </p>  <p>Most houses have two ring mains, typically upstairs and downstairs, and for convenience most have an upstairs and a downstairs lighting ring. Electric cookers typically and water heaters (immersion heaters) typically get their own spurs. Lighting, the ring mains, and high-current spurs use different sizes of cable.</p>  <p>The UK has been described as one of the most heavily fused countries on earth. As the ring main can in theory deliver 32A to the socket, each appliance has its own fuse built into the plug. That, along with the higher voltage and current, is one reason why the UK has such big plugs. These fuses are (these days) clipped into their own holder which can be (reasonably) easily extracted without taking the plug apart; they come in 3A and 13A sizes.</p>  <p>There's more, much more: bathrooms and other wet areas have their own special restrictions, there's regulations about how wires can be joined together, how many sockets can be on a ring, the distance between sockets, the number of spurs permitted, and so on and so on. A two year apprenticeship is a good start, as is careful digestion of the Wiring Regulations.</p>  <p>What can be done by a DIYer? Notionally buildings regulations have always required a "Competent Person" to do any electical work. Since the introduction of Part P of building regulations a recognised contractor needs to inspect major work or work in bathrooms and kitchens. </p>
433		<p>Whether shielding is strong enough to protect your data or not (I've not heard it is) I would think it's rare that EVERYTHING in a multi-cable is going between the exact same points A &amp; B in the same order.  Lights connect switch-to-fixture, power outlets can run a loop while network needs to take each jack back to the closet.  I wired co-ax through a room in series once, and got in trouble with the cable installer due to signal loss.  While the idea of combined cable may sound nice from an organizational standpoint, I'd think it would only be good for about 20 feet of distance in an entire house.  And it's frightfully expensive.</p>  <p>On the other hand, with a bit of organization all you need to run is power, Cat 5/6 and Coax.  Cat 5/6 &amp; RJ45 technically includes 2 phone lines, and even leaves Pins 4 and 5 as line 1 for RJ11 compatibility.  (Although never use a single wire for both phone and data, the ring voltage will kill your data.)  If you wire the entire house with Cat 5/6 and RJ45 plugs, you can use any cable as a phone line by just plugging an RJ11 into the existing outlet.  Very handy.</p>  <p>After all that, a few multi-cables can be handy.  For example, something bundling Component Video, HDMI, and a few channels of audio can be very handy to connect an A/V stack in a closet to a theater room.  But you're still talking very short runs, as you'll just need a single trunk from point A to B.</p>
434		<p>Unfortunately, you're going to have a really hard time removing it.  The usual solution is to make a couple passes over it with a drywall knife to scrape off the highest spots, then skim coat the whole ceiling to make it flat again.</p>
435		<p>My wife and I just finished doing this last month. Here's the process we took:</p>  <p><strong>Before you start, check to make sure you don't have asbestos in the popcorn.</strong> If your house is newer construction, you don't have to worry about this, but if it's older, you may want to scrape a bit off the ceiling and <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/1657/tips-to-inspect-popcorn-ceilings">send it to a lab for testing</a>. If it comes back positive, I would have professionals handle it. Otherwise:</p>  <ol> <li>Cover everything you don't want to get gross and disgusting.</li> <li>Turn off breaker for the lights and remove fixtures.</li> <li>Use a spray bottle or a garden sprayer to wet 5' by 5' sections of ceiling with water. Be careful not to oversaturate it and damage the drywall.</li> <li>Scrape off popcorn with a 6" or 12" taping knife, whichever you find easier to handle.</li> <li>Sand any spots you missed that are still rough. (For the most part, everything comes off smooth.)</li> <li>Apply mud liberally to any gouges you made. Most spots I had to go over were at the seams of the drywall.</li> <li>Sand again.</li> <li>Repeat 6 and 7 if you're OCD like me. If you want to get everything super smooth, shine a flashlight or work light parallel with the ceiling to find raised/gouged areas.</li> <li>Wipe down the ceiling to get rid of any sanding dust.</li> <li>Prime</li> <li>Paint with 2 coats of ceiling paint.</li> <li>Throw away drop cloths</li> <li>Lie on the floor and stare at your new smooth ceilings :)</li> </ol>  <p>One bit of advice: You're going to make <strong>A LOT</strong> of dust, and it will get all over everything in your house that isn't covered. We did the whole process before we moved in, so we only had to wipe down the walls and floors.</p>  <p>After you're all done, you'll probably want to change your air filter as well.</p>
436	What do-it-yourself cautionary tales do you have?	<p>I'm curious what sort of cautionary tales everyone has come across (or experienced themselves).</p>  <p>For instance, my dad used to work on live wires all the time&nbsp;â until he was putting a stove in (220V if you don't know) and touched two wires together. The spark flew off and hit his glasses and melted about halfway through the lens. He still works on live 110V, but he always turns off the 220 circuit now.</p>  <p>What about you? Any (hopefully just-as-happy) shocking experiences you folks have had?</p>
437	How do I nail furring strips without them cracking?  	<p>While remodeling my basement, I had several walls where I just put up furring strips and foam insulation rather than framing in a "real" wall.  I used 1x2 furring strips and attached them with a ramset and 1 1/2 inch nails.  </p>  <p>Problem is, putting the nails through the furring strips would quite often cause them to crack.  I tried pre-drilling (didn't really help) and also tried using 1x3 strips in some places (helped a little, but not much).</p>  <p>Is there some trick to nailing up furring strips to keep them from cracking on you?</p>
438		<p>I once had a tenant who lived next door in our duplex and thought she could hook up her own gas drier.  Smelled gas one day and couldn't find where it was coming from, so I knocked on her door.  Walked in and the whole place reeked of gas.  </p>  <p>Checked the drier, and sure enough, the supply line was barely even screwed on.  Asked her about it and got one of those "Yeah, it's been like that for a while now, was going to ask you about that" kind of responses.  Lucky it didn't take out the whole neighborhood.</p>
439	Is it worthwhile to have ductwork cleaned?	<p>Was rearranging some ductwork in my basement, and noticed that the stuff I took down was pretty filthy inside (especially the return air ducts).</p>  <p>Is it worthwhile to have ductwork cleaned out?  What kind of (if any) efficiency benefits do you get out of it?</p>
440		<p>It's not the efficiency which you get -- it's less dust in the air.  Less dust equals better health in the long run.</p>  <p>Lots of dust in the ducts is an indication of a bad air filter and/or leaks around the filter or in places where ducts join/turn.  I'd look for that as well.</p>
441		<p>We just put some new drywall directly over (under?) the existing ceiling.  It was a lot easier and cleaner than trying to take it off.  This was in a bathroom, though, so the area wasn't too big.</p>
442		<p>Treat your router like a loaded gun, it has a ton of power and can shoot things with a lot of force if you aren't using it correctly.</p>  <p>Consider that a router runs at around <strong>24,000 rpm</strong> </p>  <p>compare that to...<br> <strong>A table saw: ~4,000 RPM</strong><br> <strong>A drill: ~800 RPM</strong>  </p>  <p>The feed direction and double checking that the bit is securely locked into the chuck is critical if you value your life and/or limbs. If it is making a funny noise, stop immediately and check it, even if it is a pain in the butt.</p>  <p>Just once, I shot a loose bit across my workshop at terrifying speeds. I always check thrice since that day.</p>
443		<p>For me it was. The house I live in now was previously owned by animal owners. I'm allergic to animals and there was a ton of junk in the air ducts so the cleaning got rid of a&nbsp;lot of junk in the air.</p>
444	What are framing dimensions like in the metric world?	<p>I was always curious about this.  In the states we have:</p>  <ul> <li>Lumber - Comes most commonly in 2 inch (2x4,6,8,10,12,16) and 4 inch (4x4,4x6) varieties. </li> <li>Plywood - Almost always 4x8 feet </li> <li>Drywall/Plasterboard - Various 4 foot varieties (4x8,10,12) and sometimes 5 foot.</li> </ul>  <p>Walls are typically framed with studs 16 inches on center, rafters and joists usually the same, but sometimes 24 inches on center.  Ceilings are usually 8 feet high, or 10 feet in lots of newer construction.</p>  <p>How does this work in the metric world?</p>
445		<p>Always, always, always, always, <em>always</em> make sure the power is off before snipping 240V power cables. And when you do snip them, even if the power is off, make sure your hands are insulated.</p>  <p>We had an electrician swear to us that he had disabled all the power to one part of the building, but even so I felt a tingle so I went and confirmed with him that the power was off. He rolled his eyes and said yes. So I got my snips and cut through the wires. BANG! Lots of sparks and some very loud swear words. Thankfully I just happened by pure chance to have my hands insulated.</p>
446		<p>(Un)fortuantely in Australia the dimensions are exactly the same. Which always throws me when I measure in MM and I go to the hardware store and they start talking in feet and inches.</p>  <p>It also answers questions about why some things are such incredibly odd dimensions. When you convert them from fractions-of-a-cm to feet/inches they usually fit some arcane measuring standard from the 1920s.</p>
447		<p>Depends on the country.  Most English-speaking countries use imperial system, but convert all the dimensions into m/cm/mm and kg.  For example, <a href="http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/bq/nav.jsp?action=detail&amp;fh_secondid=9275853&amp;fh_reftheme=promo_159030150%2cseeall%2c%2f%2fcatalog01%2fen_GB%2fcategories%3c%7b9372016%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b9372053%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b9372280%7d&amp;fh_view_size=10&amp;fh_location=%2f%2fcatalog01%2fen_GB%2fcategories%3c%7b9372016%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b9372053%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b9372280%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b9392124%7d&amp;ts=1279925082052" rel="nofollow">this is a 2x4</a></p>  <p>However, it's usually not an issue outside of US/Canada, as most of the other world doesn't build houses out of dimensional lumber.  They use bricks, cement blocks, cement panels, etc. and the dimensions are almost always communicated in millimeters</p>  <p>Most of the plumbing/windows-doors/etc. uses metric system.</p>
448		<p>In Canada, while officially we are metric, all the construction work I've been around is done almost entirely in imperial. Everything comes in the same dimensions, and is referred to in feet and inches. Framing is done 16 or 24" on center, standard ceilings are 8' high. </p>  <p>Part of this may just be a hold-over from years of everyone doing that way, and then passing that on as they teach younger tradespeople. In school, I grew up learning the metric system, with the most exposure to feet/inches while doing fractions in math class. </p>  <p>I think part of it has to do with convenience and standardization as well: a "1.22 x 2.44m plywood" is awkward to say, and changing the dimensions slightly to 1.25 x 2.5 m would be strange. 16" (0.406m) centers is about the right distance for drywall, and so if you had 1.25m sheets of drywall, your centers would have to be 0.416m (or 16.4") to work out.. that's awkward to deal with. </p>  <p>Personally, I use a tape measure that has both centimeters and feet/inches on it, and often use cm if I'm measuring any more accurately than 1/8". One thing imperial has going for it, is the foot is a very handy size. There is no equivalent in metric (the decimeter (10cm / 0.1m / 3.9") is too small (plus no one ever says the word "decimeter"), while the meter (3.28ft) is too big).</p>
449	How can we fix bouncy floors?	<p>Our floors are somewhat bouncy, especially in big rooms with long joists.  I think that the main cause is that they used 2x8 joists on 15-20' spans.</p>  <p>We are going to replace/install hardwood in several areas.  Given that we'll have access to the subfloor, what can be done to make the floors less bouncy?</p>  <p>Note: looks like it's different from the situation described in <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/277/spongy-soft-spot-on-hardwood-floor" rel="nofollow">http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/277/spongy-soft-spot-on-hardwood-floor</a>, since the floor moves as a whole and not just in some places and there are no hollow spots there.</p>
450		<p>You may be using the wrong load.  <a href="http://www.ramset.com/fasteners.asp" rel="nofollow">This site</a> recommends using a Yellow #4 load on strips 3/4" thick, or Green #3 for 1/4" - 1/2".  </p>  <p>You could also use concrete screws.</p>  <ul> <li>Pre-drill holes in furring strip and wall (about every 24").</li> <li>Clean holes in walls well (with shop-vac).</li> <li>Using concrete screws fasten furring strip to wall (do not over tighten).</li> </ul>
451		<p>I would just get a sound bar. </p>  <p>not as good as actual 2 back speakers, but better then 2, and can't beat its simplicity (one item replacing 4 speakers, a dvd player and the AV box).</p>
452	Should I replace or repair my dead/dying garage door?	<p>My garage door opener is on its last legs, should I replace it or try to fix it?  </p>  <p>Symptoms:</p>  <ul> <li>The door does not initially move when the button is pushed, but after giving the door a boost it opens.</li> <li>The door works fine on its own, it is definitely a problem with the motor. </li> <li>The motor does not start when disconnected from the door, but giving it a boost makes it spin. So this has nothing to do with the door.</li> </ul>  <p>I have worked with electric motors in the past but am far from an expert, and in most cases when dealing with them it was a huge pain in the neck.  I'm guessing this is a problem with the brushes, but have never opened up a motor from a garage door opener before so I'm not sure what to expect.</p>  <p>Can these things be repaired, or is it cheaper and easier to buy a replacement?</p>
453		<p>Be careful when walking/working in your unfinished attic... it is very easy to miss a beam and put your foot through the ceiling.  Best thing to do is use a piece of plywood if you need to work up there for any extended period of time.</p>
454		<p>Also look into using construction adhesive to attach the furring strips and then fewer masonry screws.</p>
455	What is the easiest method to fish cable through the ceiling?	<p>I need to fish some speaker wire through my ceiling downstairs to the lower part of the adjacent exterior wall. To compound the problem, the ceiling joists run perpendicular to the direction I need to run the cable. I have a feeling I already know the answer to this, but is there any way <em>other</em> than cutting several holes in the ceiling to drill through the joists? The run is about 10 feet.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>The ceiling is a smooth drywall ceiling. The joists are I joists.</p>
456		<p>A quick google for 'Drill Bit Extension' turned up a 72" extension - that might at least cut down the number of holes involved. </p>
457		<p>Are you sure the door still moves smoothly? That opener does NOT have enough power to move the door if something is wrong. Try disconnecting the door from the opener and make sure it moves smoothly (springs still good an in adjustment, all wheels move smoothly, etc).</p>
458		<p>Consider through the crown molding, or installing some to hide the dable.  See <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/420/ways-to-wire-rear-speakers-in-a-home-theater-system/427#427" rel="nofollow">my response to wiring rear speakers</a></p>
459		<p>I figured out a workaround for this.  Today, rather than using actual furring strips, I just ripped a sheet of 3/4 inch plywood into strips on the table saw.  Being plywood, it doesn't split.  Not an ideal solution, but worked out pretty well for me.</p>
461		<p>In a typical US home, you will have 220 volt, 100 or 200 amp service.</p>  <p>In a typical home there are 4 separate connections. They consist of 2 "hot" wires, a ground, and a neutral.</p>  <p>We have what is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-phase_electric_power" rel="nofollow">split-phase electric power</a>. A distribution transformer has a single-phase input (primary) winding. The output (secondary) winding is center-tapped and the center tap connected to a grounded neutral. The other two wires are the "hot" wires, and have a voltage between them of about 220 volts. The voltage between each of them and neutral is half of that. That is why our system is often referred to as a 110 volt system.</p>  <p>The ground and neutral share a wire from the electric company. The neutral/ground wire gets attached to Earth Ground at the main breaker box, or at the meter (sometimes both). The Earth Ground is usually both a metal stake in the ground, and the building's water line (if it is metal).</p>  <p>The main breaker panel is the only one where the ground and neutral buses are attached to each-other. Even though the neutral and ground wires are connected to each other in the main panel, there may be a significant voltage between them near the end of a run.</p>  <p>There is never any loops in a properly wired building, with the possible exception of the ground wires.</p>  <hr>  <p>For most lighting, and electrical outlets, you use one of the "hot" wires, along with a "neutral" wire for power, along with a ground wire for safety.</p>  <p>The white neutral wire gets attached to the neutral bus, and the bare, or green ground wire gets attached to the ground bus.</p>  <p>The hot wire is generally black, but may be any color other than white, or green. If a white wire is used as a hot wire it must be wrapped with electrical tape of another color. Common examples of white wires being used as a hot wire include end-of-line light switches, and for devices which use 220 volts without a neutral wire.</p>  <p>For switched lighting, and outlets, you <strong>always</strong> switch the hot wire.</p>  <p>For a given run the hot and neutral wires are always the same gauge. The ground wire is never smaller than the hot and neutral wires, in romex cable.</p>  <p>Armored cable, and wires run through metal conduit can often be run without a separate ground wire. Instead you would use the armor, or the conduit as the ground connection.</p>  <hr>  <p>For appliances which require 220 volts, you will use two breakers which have a connection between them which will cause both breakers to turn on and off together. Newer breakers appear to be a single double-wide breaker which works the same way. Because of the way most breaker panels are arranged, two breakers side by side will be on separate phases.</p>  <hr>  <p>There exists different plugs for each voltage, and current loads.</p>  <p>The major exception is for 110 volts, at 15 and 20 amps. 20 amp receptacles have an extra slot on the hot connection, but are otherwise identical to 15 amp receptacles. You can plug any 15 amp plug into a regular 20 amp receptacle.</p>  <p>It is very rare to actually see a device which has a 20 amp plug on them. This is because you will often have 15 amp only receptacles on a 20 amp service.</p>  <p>Most devices have no fuses, or breakers of their own.</p>
462		<p>Depending on your house, it may be easier to lift the floor in the room above. There's almost bound to be a run of cable or pipe that goes across the ceiling that already has holes or notches in the joist.</p>  <p>Lifting floorboards is much easier than messing with a ceiling!</p>
463		<p>I've been a bit cynical of these but tried push-fit on my last project -- works a treat.</p>  <p>Pros: it's really really fast and easy, you're more likely to get it right first time, and you can use PEX tubing which is lovely and flexible, so brilliant for doing e.g. taps for a basin on a stud partition.</p>  <p>Cons: expensive. Much more expensive. And you'd not want to use them on exposed pipework.</p>
464		<p>I have not used the multi-cables but I don't think they're a good idea because I suspect you'll end up abandoning half of the cables in the bundle a few years down the road, and needing to pull some other type of cable. </p>  <p>Running 110 AC in the same bundle and to the same electrical boxes as your low-voltage data/telecom/AV stuff sounds like an invitation to interference.</p>  <p>Unless you're seriously overengineering your electrical system, you're not going to end up with a "home run" configuration between the electrical panel and your outlets/switches/lamps; you'll probably end up with a few outlets or lamps daisy-chained on the same wire run from the circuit breaker. That's fine for 110; but it's not how people wire Ethernet these days, and I would suggest the "home run" or star topology for your data and AV, too, just to maximize flexibility in the future.  </p>  <p>I'd also be concerned about combination 110 and low voltage in the same bundle in the event there were some sort of failure/penetration of the bundle - you might end up shorting the 110 right into the low voltage wiring, which would probably be the end of whatever nice equipment you had hooked up to the low voltage (network, phone, CATV) stuff. I wouldn't want to have to turn off electrical circuits because I wanted to monkey with network/speaker wiring - but I wouldn't want to work with knives/diagonal cutters/etc on a cable bundle with live 110 in it, either. </p>  <p>If I were specifying new construction, I'd ask for several home runs of the blue "<a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=smurf+tube" rel="nofollow">smurf tube</a>" low voltage conduit to each room - my personal preference is to use Cat 6 for everything (LAN + telephone + CCTV) that doesn't absolutely require coax, but I'm not a big CATV/satellite watcher so my tastes may be relatively unsophisticated in that regard. </p>  <p>I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that it's impossible to anticipate what you'll want/need in the future, and how technology will change, so you should set things up so you can run new cabling without tearing up walls, or being forced to rip out your entire existing installation. </p>
465		<p>Wikipedia has a pretty good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knob_and_tube_wiring">explanation with pictures</a>. </p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YaotG.jpg" alt="knob and tube wiring in 1930s home"></p>
466		<p>Well, I had one that more so lead to a DIY project then happened during.</p>  <p>Commercial building built in the 1930s, had lamps hanging from ceiling by chains.</p>  <p>One day I'm changing a light bulb and someone walks in and flips the light switch.</p>  <p>It threw my arm back, almost knocked me off the ladder, and my hand was spotted black for a little while.</p>  <p>The wiring running through the chain to the lamp was cloth insulated and had broken down over the years.  Needless to say, I spent the rest of the day rewiring all of the lamps in the building.</p>  <p>So, be mindful of working in old buildings, even on the simplest of tasks.</p>
467		<p>It might be worth checking out the subfloor if you can get access to it in case that is what is not holding up to weight instead of the joists.</p>  <p>Otherwise, I know in your comment you stated that you don't have the joists exposed, unfortunately, I don't know of a way to resolve the issue without exposing them as anything you tried to do at the floor level would just be adding weight.</p>  <p>If you don't feel your joists are up to snuff, you can reinforce them by laminating them.</p>  <p>You would get additional boards of appropriate size to fit snugly next to the joists, then use an adhesive and screw the boards to the joists.</p>  <p>Make sure you are getting the additional wood over your load bearing walls, otherwise again you are just adding weight to the situation.</p>  <p>Remember though, even if you are going to make it a DIY project, structural work is a big deal and you should at least consult a contractor/architect and make sure you get proper permits and inspections.</p>  <p>You can save yourself the money on the labor, but don't skimp on the planning.</p>
468		<p>You might be better off avoiding the ceiling altogether and going all the way down to the basement (if possible), across, and then back up again OR go up to the attic, across, and then back down again.  It adds about 20 more feet to the run but assuming you have access to either the basement or attic it would be significantly easier.  </p>
469		<p>Lots of things can be wrong with your garage door or opener:</p>  <ol> <li>It could be something as simple as needing to replace the springs. If they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_spring" rel="nofollow">torsion springs</a>, you're going to want to consult a professional, as they can store a deadly amount of tension. Consider it as dangerous as electric repairs.</li> <li>Some garage door openers operate on battery. You might need to replace them.</li> <li>Some garage door openers have adjustable settings. This is probably not the problem because you've noticed a degradation in performance and haven't indicated fiddling with the settings at all.</li> <li>It could be a misaligned track, causing unnecessary work for the motor.</li> <li>If all else fails, it's the motor. It's cheaper to replace it!</li> </ol>
470	Why does it take a long time for water to start draining from my tub faucet?	<p>Sorry for the awkwardly worded title, I couldn't really describe the issue in one sentence.</p>  <p>My shower has a handle that controls both pressure and temperature. To begin showering, I turn the handle, then pull up the stopper (is this the right word?) on the tub faucet to get the water to come out the shower head instead of the tub faucet. </p>  <p>For the first few weeks, when I was done showering, I'd simply turn the pressure/temperature handle, the shower would turn off, and the stopper would immediately drop, letting out the remaining water through the tub faucet. </p>  <p>Now, however, it takes a good 10 - 15 seconds between turning the handle and the stopper dropping. It's not a huge deal on it's own, but I also notice that the water never fully transfers to shower-head-only when I pull up the stopper, and some continues to come out of the tub faucet. </p>  <p>I think it's affecting the pressure of my shower and it's just annoying. Any idea on how to fix it?</p>
471	Is it a good idea to lay a second course of shingles over an existing shingled roof?	<p>My shingles were a little worse for wear and I had a "friend-of-a-friend-who-used-to-be-a-roofer" come take a look at it and he said I could save some money on the demolition by just laying another course of shingles over the first. </p>  <p>He claimed it was a common technique and they did it all the time at his job, but it sounds a little hinky to me. </p>  <p>Is this really commonly done? Is it a good idea? What Are there downsides?</p>
472		<p>It is common to lay up to three layers (at least in my area), but if the roof has lifting shingles laying another layer will just lift the new shingles.  If the roof is bad, it is better and probably cheaper in the long run to remove the old shingles and lay the new ones fresh. </p>  <p>If the roof is not that bad a second layer can definitely save money, just make sure you check your local codes before doing it.</p>  <p>Another concern can be weight. Shingles weigh a lot so the more layers you add the more weight your roof has to carry, if you live in an area with heavy show fall weight could become more of an issue.</p>  <p>Personaly I prefer to start fresh each time, but I save money by doing the demo myself.</p>
473		<p>The stopper you're describing is called the diverter. The symptoms you're describing sound like it's gotten slightly bent or nicked. I would take it apart and try re-setting the pin. Maybe scrub it a bit with a light abrasive to true it up. If that doesn't work, replace it. I assume your diverter is in your tub spout. You can usually remove that by removing the hex-head set-screw and then rotating the entire spout (the padded handle of a hammer stuck in the spout can help you get a grip).</p>
474		<p>As an aside, remember that basement concrete walls are <em>not</em> watertight, so when the ground is wet, the interior concrete may get moisture on the inside. Furring strips directly against concrete is a good way to end up with wet wood, which means mold and rot. Same goes for where the basement floor meets the studs. Full framing an inch or so from the wall with foam insulation behind is better for keeping the finished wall dry, even though you'll lose some interior space.</p>
475	Sealing a cork tile floor?	<p>I just finished installing a cork tile floor (US Floors brand). If I do say so myself, it looks gorgeous! Cork is not generally recommended for a bathroom, but we felt that a half-bath should be a safe bet (not nearly the moisture around as in a full bath).</p>  <p>But just for peace of mind, I thought it might be a good idea to seal the cork -- the tiles themselves are pre-sealed, but not the joints (which are incredibly tight, but something could get through).</p>  <p>What should I use? Or should I even attempt to seal it?</p>
476	What is the best way to repair a cracked bathtub?	<p>Close examination of the floor of my bathtub has revealed a long, thin crack in the bathtub itself.  The bathtub is one of the common plastic-feeling variety (though I am not sure if it is actually a plastic.)  What is the best way to patch this crack?</p>
477	How can I paint over a glossy surface that might contain lead paint?	<p>I am repainting a bathroom that includes trim with a high gloss.  The house is old (1924) and the existing paint may have lead in it.  There was a remodel in the '80s, but I can't guarantee the current paint was applied then.</p>  <p>My local paint store advised against sanding to take off the gloss, because of the lead risk.  They recommended a "liquid sandpaper" product which I applied.  However, the first coat of the new paint did not stick (I've been stripping it back off for the last couple of weekends).  The paint store also advised I did not need a primer, which I now believe was a mistake.</p>  <p>How can I get the new paint to stick to the old?</p>
478		<p>Congratulations on the cork.  I put cork in my master bathroom a few years ago and it was the best floor I've ever had - warm in the morning and soft under bare feet.  I liked it so much I put cork in our kitchen too.</p>  <p>My feeling is that you don't need to seal it.  I didn't see any lifting or swelling on our floor over three years.  We're not especially fastidious people either - we basically just swiped puddles with a towel when we saw them.</p>  <p>Any sealant you put on that is capable of sealing the joints will be a film finish.  My gut says the subtle expansion and contraction of the cork along with the flex of the floor will crack a film finish like that in pretty short order, defeating the purpose.</p>  <p>One thing you could try if you're nervous is some clear wax.  Test it under a cabinet or something to see if you can force a tiny bit into the seam and still thoroughly remove it from the surface.  Also satisfy yourself that the solvent in wax doesn't damage the finish of the cork tiles. If it works ok, it might slow down penetration of water into the seams while still remaining flexible. </p>
479		<p>ManiacZX mentioned laminating the joists below, and in my opinion, if you had access to the joists, you'd be better off <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Flooring/Floor-Repair/fixing-bouncy-floors/Step-By-Step#step2">installing bracing between them</a> (cribbing, bridging, whatever you want to call it) ... but that assumes that you actually had access to the joists.</p>  <p>as you're going to be gaining access to the subfloor, you might be able to stiffen the floor as a whole -- put down some adhesive, lay more plywood/chipboard on top of it (ply's more expensive but it flexes less ... I'm not sure how MDF compares to plywood on flexibility), and then screw it down tight to the original subfloor.  (and a <em>lot</em> of screws -- might even be worth renting a belt fed screwgun, as you're going to want them every 6" (15cm) or so to make sure the new subfloor is bonded well to the existing one, so they flex as a single unit.</p>  <p>If you can get the floor stiffer, it'll distribute the load better across multiple joists, and therefore they should deflect less when loaded.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>Your other option is to come in from the top -- strip the existing subfloor off, install the cribbing, then lay the subfloor back down.  Depending on how the subfloor is laid, you might be able to cut windows into it (set a circular saw so it just barely goes through the sheet; you might have to drill a hole and use a wire w/ a bent end as a guage first), expose enough to set the cribbing, close it back up, then to the lamination thing I mentioned above to stiffen the subfloor.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>It's possible that installing the hardwood floor might help to spread load better (especially if it's laid so it's perpendicular to the floor, and nailed in, rather than a floating floor), but it'd really suck to go to the work of laying the new floor, and then have to tear it up because it's still a problem.</p>
480		<p>Rather than just seal in paint that might be lead-based, especially as you mentioned that you're stripping off the bad coat, it might be worth finally just removing it so you don't have to go through these concerns in the future.  (especially if you don't have kids now, but think you might in the future, so you can get the dust over and done with).</p>  <p>New York has some <a href="http://www.nyhealth.gov/publications/2502/" rel="nofollow">recommendations for removing lead paint</a>.  The important thing is to keep it from becoming dust and getting spread around the house, which just makes things worse.  I believe there are some chemical paint strippers that can be used with lead paint, although that website didn't mention any.  I also found mention that <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/article/0,,386353,00.html" rel="nofollow">Massachusets used to require licensed contractors and require it to be disposed of as hazardous waste</a>, so it might be worth checking before you attempt this.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>If you were going to attempt this without stripping it all off, I'd follow the New York guidelines (contain the area), wet sand to rough up the surface, then prime it and re-paint.</p>  <p>Oh ... and you can also get test kits for check for lead paint.  Odds are, being gloss and trim, it's more likely though, and even if the top coat isn't, there might be lead in an older coat.</p>
481	Timber Veneer Flooring?	<p>We have existing polished timber floors, it is patchy (different parts of the house are floored with different kinds of timber) it also has a few gaps and holes. We are thinking of laying down some kind of timber veneer over the top, is this a good idea and if so what are the best materials available? (Ideally it would look as authentic as possible)</p>
482		<p>You might think about replacing the tub.</p>
483		<p>Most bathtubs that aren't cast iron or steel are acrylic plastic.</p>  <p>If the crack is right through the tub and water is leaking though, you should replace the tub.  If it's an emergency and you need a short-term repair, I'd use a two-part epoxy.  Choose a thin epoxy (2:1 ratio) from the selection at the home center and use a putty knife to try to force it into the crack.  Let it cure for 24 hours.  This will be at best a short term solution because if tub cracked it must be because it flexed in that spot - it will flex again and the brittle epoxy repair will crack again quickly.</p>  <p>If the crack is a surface scratch, it can be repaired with a repair kit such as offered by <a href="http://www.surface-repair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.surface-repair.com/</a>.  The problem is color matching: your tub will have changed color over time and it will be difficult or impossible to get a good match.</p>  <p>Another approach is using fine sandpaper.  You can get very fine wet-and-dry sandpaper at an auto parts store like Napa.  Get 320, 600, 1200 and 2000 grit.  Apply some elbow grease to the scratch with the 320.  Try to keep the scratches localized and in one direction.  Use the 320 until the scratch is gone.  Then move to the 600 and keep it up until the scratches from the 320 are gone.  By the time you're done 1200 you may be satisfied, but if not you should be able to get a fairly glossy finish with the 2000.</p>
484	Is a 2x4 strong enough to hold up a porch swing?	<p>I'm hanging a porch swing, but the beams run the wrong direction for the support hooks.  I've looked up in the attic, and there's a 2x4, lying flat, that runs the correct direction.  Will that be strong enough to support, say, 500 lbs?  Due to the angle of my roof, I can't actually reach the board so there's no hope of supporting it from above.</p>  <p>There's really nothing stopping me from getting a different style of support hook (one that drills into the wood at a single spot instead of two), but if possible, I'd like to use what I've got.</p>
485	How do I do a minor grout repair properly?	<p>I've got grout between some floor tiles that is cracking and coming out in small chips, over time.  The tiles and remaining grout are otherwise in great shape.  I suspect this is just a problem high-traffic area of the floor in our hallway.  I'm not about to tear up the entire floor to solve the underlying issue.</p>  <p>But, if I did want to patch the grout (while accepting it is likely to crack again, down the road) what is the proper way to fill in missing grout so that new grout bonds with the old?  Should I remove any more of the old that appears to be cracking before filling in?</p>
486		<p>Depends on the distance from water. Homebase, of all people, have a good guide <a href="http://www.homebase.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/BuyingGuideCmd?langId=-1&amp;storeId=20001&amp;bgTrail=00015" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>  <p>In summary, lights in the bath must be 12V and completely waterproof (zone 0). If it's in reach of a bath (standing up or sitting down) your choices are limited to completely waterproof sealed units (rated IPX4) and you'll need a 30mA RCD (zone 1). Other areas at risk of splashing (Zone 3, including above sinks) need IPX4 splash-resistant fittings but don't need the RCD. Outside of that - in zone 3 - anything will do.</p>  <p>You may need to have the completed work inspected under Part P of the buildings regulations. Give buildings control at your local council a call - they can advise. </p>
487	How do I fix laminate flooring that's begun to rise in the middle?	<p>We have laminate flooring in our kitchen/lounge and over the winter (which are cold and damp here in New Zealand) the flooring has begun to rise up in a couple of places. It was fitted by the previous owner and it appeared that they had left enough gap around the edge for expansion, but it turns out they didn't. Is there a solution to fix this without having to take most of it up and shorten/reshape a lot of bits?</p>  <p>One option we've had suggested is to get a dehumidifier in there to take the moisture out, but that doesn't seem like a long-term fix!</p>
488	How do I make our toilet flush less vigorously?	<p>Our toilet flushes so vigorously that water splashes out of the top of it. Is there a way I can "tune" the flush so that it doesn't flush so hard?</p>
489	What technique should I use to remove rubble from earth, using a small excavator?	<p>I've a patch of earth - mostly fairly sticky Gloucestershire clay - which our previous builder has left  mixed up with bricks, larger lumps of concrete and who knows what else. I want to level this and leave enough earth on the surface to let wildflowers and perhaps grass grow. </p>  <p>I'm not expecting this to ever turn into a beautiful lawn, so I'm quite happy to have a go myself with a smallish excavator. The particular bit of land will end up hidden behind a coppice so it needs to be made tidy but not perfect. It's about 30' by 70' in all, with a few trees, and on a slight slope.</p>  <p>Can anyone share techniques on how best to approach this? Should I consider hiring a driver with the digger, or is this feasible as a DIY job? I've used a digger for a weekend before on a lighter job but nothing quite on this scale.</p>
491		<p>I'm from all metric country, but lot of stuff in constructing busyness are in "cols" that is inches. Again things like 2" or 4" are around 5cm and 10cm, so it's all round numbers.</p>
492		<p>When I've done grout repair I've cleaned out the old grout, did some slight prodding to see if anything else was loose, made sure the area was bone dry and then got a small batch of grout from the local hardware store. You can probably buy a small tub of the premixed grout (unless you have colored grout then you're stuck buying a larger tub usually).</p>  <p>I just put it on as normal grout, slap it on, push it in, smooth it out a bit, let it dry and wipe off the excess. It'll take a little while to fade in but now it looks like it was part of the original tile job.</p>
493	Can I lay pavers over a concrete patio?	<p>I have a concrete patio in my backyard that's in pretty good condition.  We don't like how it looks, so we'd like to cover it up with brick or pavers.  Looking online, it appears that most people install pavers over gravel, so I was wondering if it was a good idea to lay the pavers straight on the concrete patio.  Would drainage be an issue?  What kind of cement would I use to secure the pavers on the concrete?</p>
494		<p>There are several issues to consider - whether the 2x4 itself is strong enough to bear the load you're putting on it in the direction that you're loading it (so the grade/type of wood is important, not all 2x4's are created equal), whether the fastener/hook you use will overstress the wood in the 2x4 at the point where it attaches, and whether the load on the 2x4 will overstress/exceed the capacity of whatever it is that's attaching the 2x4 to whatever it is that it's attached to/supported by.</p>  <p>My unscientific, short answer is "no", I wouldn't depend on a 2x4 of unknown provenance to support the weight of 2 adults (or any number of children) + the weight of the swing, especially given wear &amp; degradation over time.</p>  <p>If it was a short run of 2x4 and the swing was attached really well and the 2x4 is attached really well to something strong, yeah, it'll probably work, but if it were my house/family involved, I'd look for a stronger way to hang the swing. </p>
495		<p>In most toilets (those that aren't pressure assist), there's a float that will stop water from the tank at a given level.  There's usually some adjustment to change the level that the toilet will fill to.</p>  <p>Placing something into the tank is used to reduce the amount of water that's used per flush, but as there's still the same depth of water per flush, it won't change the initial pressure of the flush, which is what's going to give you the "vigor" behind the flush.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>Pressure assist toilets are another beast -- I've never had one, so I have no idea how to tune them.  They fill a sealed container, so rather than being exposed to the air, they have the full line pressure to use in the flush.  I would hope that there'd be something in either the manual for the toilet, or the manufacturer's website on how to make adjustments.</p>  <p>If you take the lid off tank, and there's no water visible, then it's likely a pressure assist.  If there's no tank ... well, it's likely drawing from line pressure entirely, as they do with commercial toilets.  (actually -- I saw a <em>lot</em> of tankless toilets when I was  in Europe ... with the flush mechanism in the wall, so it's possible that there's a tank in the wall ... but I have no idea how you would adjust and/or service those).</p>
496		<p>For adjusting the water level in the fill tank, all of the toilets I've come across are adjustable, there is no need to put something in the tank to offset the volume.</p>  <p>There will be a float of some sort that is attached to a valve.  To have less water fill the tank, you want to adjust the float to sit lower in the tank, thus less water is needed to push the valve closed.</p>  <p>For the two fill mechanisms I'm familiar with:</p>  <ul> <li><p>For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballcock" rel="nofollow">the float arm style</a> there is either an adjustment screw or you can bend the arm.</p></li> <li><p>For the newer float on the pipe style, see <a href="http://www.acmehowto.com/howto/homemaintenance/plumbing/toilet/filllevel.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Again, simply the attachment between the float and the top should have an adjustment, move the float lower in the tank so that a lower amount of water pushes the valve closed.</p></li> </ul>
497		<p>The only real way to do it is to screen it -- you use a series of trays and screens of varios sizes so that only soil smaller than a given size can pass through.</p>  <p>When I did a small patch at my home, (putting in a french drain), I used a bread tray that I had fit with ~1cm hardware mesh to reduce the size of the holes, but that took two of us to shake it, and a fair bit of work.  If I was doing a large amount, I'd build something to suspend the frames, so you could load a bucket of soil in, shake it, then dump the screened debris to the side (as the soil will fall straight through).</p>  <p>The clay is going to bring other problems -- if you don't load the screens too much, and get the rocks bumping into each other, it will hopefully knock off the clay, and fall through; if you want to be <em>really</em> thorough, you'd wash the dirt through the screen (eg, if you were trying to do a soil analysis, which you're not), but it'd make a real mess, so I wouldn't recommend it.</p>  <p>Depending on the size of the rubble, I might go with two screens -- one about 3" / 7.5cm, to catch the really large items and the other between 1 and 2 cm (~0.5") to catch gravel sized bits.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>From the sounds of things (sticky clay) this will <em>not</em> be fast work.  I'd try to figure out the technique just digging by hand, and test everything to find out how fast things will go, and then consider getting some friends in to help shake the trays, move the finished stuff around, etc, so if you are renting a machine and/or hiring an operator for it, you don't have to go through the learning process while you're wasting time on the excavator.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>You might have to deal with more than one layer -- if there's an obvious topsoil layer, and a clay layer, you'll want to handle them separately, so you're not putting too much clay on top for planting; for this it might be worth hiring someone experienced who can be more precise in the removal.  (I'm not sure how difficult it is to operate the excavator, but if you're spending the first few hours trying to learn how to do things half-decent, it's potentially a lot of lost time if you're trying to get this done over a weekend)  Hopefully, an experienced person will also do less harm to the roots of trees -- if nothing else, their experience might tell them how close they can get before you have to switch to hand tools.</p>
498		<p>One thing to check before replacing items is the inline filter (if present). When my shower was performing poorly, I unscrewed the head and found a small mesh screen in the line that was clogging up. I cleaned it out and screwed everything back together to find my pressure right back where I expected it. :)</p>
499	How to fix a leaking faucet aerator	<p>I removed the aerator on my kitchen faucet and attached a hose for a time and cleaned the aerator.  Now I cannot get the original one to screw back into the place without it leaking (well spraying mostly).  Any suggestions on ways or tools to get an aerator firmly back in place?</p>
500		<p>Is there any chance you've cross-threaded it?  If you're sure it's not cross-threaded, then I'd check for a missing washer or O-ring.  It may have blown out of the aerator when you were backflushing it with the hose.</p>
501		<p>A 2x8 joist on a 20' span is <em>extremely</em> undersized.  What is the center-to-center spacing of your joists?  If I were you I'd seriously consider pulling up the subfloor at least in the center third of your longer spans, and sistering in extra joists as described by ManiacZX.</p>
502		<p>To expand on NotDan's answer:</p>  <ul> <li>Use an angled brush (I generally use a 1.5").</li> <li>Hold the brush close to the bristles, not by the handle.</li> <li>Dip the brush about 1/2" into the paint, and wipe the paint off one side of the brush.</li> <li>Start your line with the longer bristles (the "point" of the brush) on the line, and the shorter bristles about 1/4" away from the line.  The brush should be closer to flat against the wall than perpendicular to the wall.</li> <li>Apply just enough pressure so that the longer trailing bristles are fairly curved as you pull the brush along.</li> <li>Think about whether you want to overshoot or undershoot your edge: for example on a window casing, where you're less likely to see the edge of the trim, it's better to overshoot and get a little wall paint on the trim than to leave trim color on the wall where it can be seen from the middle of the room.</li> </ul>
503		<p>I'm no expert on this but I'll throw in my two cents.  If you were looking to make this into a manicured lawn I'd recommend bringing in topsoil to cover up all the junk.  But since you're not, instead of an excavator I'd look into renting a compact tractor with a plow and a rake attachment.  Plowing will bring most of the junk to the surface and you can remove the bigger stuff by hand.  Then go around with the rake to smooth things out.  If you set the rake at an angle and go around in a spiral pattern starting at the perimeter, the bricks and rocks will all collect in the center.  Then you can pick them up with the loader bucket on the tractor and move them to some out of the way location like your neighbor's yard.</p>
504		<p>Really, 2x8? That's undersized for a 20-foot span, even if your house is old enough for full-sized lumber. 15 foot would even be iffy in my book for a 2x8 (though I'm not a structural engineer).</p>  <p>Like Mike and ManiacZX, I would recommend tearing out the subfloor and laminating the existing joists across the entire span, both for better carrying the load and helping to decrease the give in the flooring. Modern flooring is much less forgiving than, say, old hardwood floors.</p>  <p>If you have large spacing of joists and sistering still doesn't get you down to 16" OC or less, add bracing as Joe recommended. Also, use two layers of new subfloor, perpendicular to one another and fastened with both lots of screws and adhesive to one another and the joists.</p>  <p>Also, especially if this is an older home, check the level of the home itself--that may be one source of the problems.</p>
505	How to keep home automation complexity under control?	<p>If you installed some form of home automation (lighting control for example), how did you keep the complexity manageable for your family members?</p>  <p>In many cases where friends have installed some form of home automation, I see that the person who wanted it and decided on the individual settings is the only one comfortable with it. The others? Not so much.</p>  <p>They think there are too many buttons (<em>"We used to have a single button and light everywhere, now there are eight, and I always have to try them all to get the right one"</em>), too many options (pressing once vs. holding, on-off vs dimming - <em>"Why doesn't that light turn on?" "It is, it's just dimmed all the way down"</em>), and they see it as just one of the new toys of their husband or father. The same thing with home theater setups (<em>"Why do I need three remotes to watch TV?"</em> [TV screen, set-top box, audio installation] <em>"We had a simple TV, and I liked it!"</em>)</p>  <p>Do you recognize this situation? What can be done to prevent it? I understand the difference Don Norman makes between a "complex world" and a "complicated user interface", but are we maybe making the world/our house too complex ourselves?</p>  <p>(Of course, since this is a site for DIY'ers, and an offspring of Stack Overflow, most of us will be the enthusiastic husbands and fathers. Bonus points for answers written together with your wives and children!)</p>
506	Why does my toilet intermittently run continually?	<p>I've pretty much fixed up my bathroom since moving in. The last bit of annoyance now is this:</p>  <p>Not every time, but every 10 or so flushes, my toilet will run continually. It'll sound like it's water is filling up for about two minutes, then stop for five minutes, then sound like it's filling up again... on repeat. To stop it, I have to go back in and jiggle the handle. </p>  <p>One time I took the lid off the top of the toilet and it looked like it was slowly losing water from the top (or whatever it's called). </p>  <p>Any idea on how to fix this?</p>
507		<p>If you're technically inclined, I saw one post hovering round the tubes about a guy that did some home automation - namely zoning, via 2 wire temperature sensors for the rooms, servo motors to control the registers, and a Linux box to rule them all.</p>  <p>Of course I can't find the link now that I look for it...</p>
508		<p>I would first try to replace the flapper, it may be old and worn and not creating a proper seal.  If that does not work try replacing the ballcock (float valve), as these too can become old and worn and not function properly.  </p>
510		<p>If the water is leaking from the top, then you probably have the shut off level too high (the level set where the float eventually rises and shuts off the flow of water into the toilet tank).  Then the water can continue to "leak" out and eventually it might trigger the tank to start filling again (on windy days you might see it happen more as the wind blows and moves the water in the toilet and tank).  You should be able to adjust the arm that attaches to the float so that the shut off happens and the level of water is below the top of the "tube" (not sure what that is called).</p>
511		<p>The following information is from Norway, but I would expect that the same dimensions are used elsewhere in Europe.  The system used there parallels what we have here in the U.S., but the actual dimensions are different.  Colloquially, terms like âtwo-by-fourâ are used, but the actual millimeter sizes are used in price lists, etc.  </p>  <p>The dimensions referred to by the colloquial terms are quite a bit bigger than in the U.S.  For instance, a U.S. milled four-by-four is actually 3.5Â inches (89 mm).  In contrast, a Norwegian milled âfour-by-fourâ is actually 3.86 in (98 mm).</p>  <p>Here is a table I compiled with some common dimensions:</p>  <pre> <h2>Milled structural lumber dimensions</h2> <b>Actual size (Europe)     Actual size (U.S.)     Nominal size (U.S.)</b>  30Â mm  1.18Â in               36Â mm  1.42Â in               48Â mm  1.89Â in           38Â mm  1.50Â in             2Â in  61Â mm  2.40Â in               73Â mm  2.87Â in           64Â mm  2.50Â in             3Â in  98Â mm  3.86Â in           89Â mm  3.50Â in             4Â in 123Â mm  4.84Â in          114 mm  4.50 in             5 in 148Â mm  5.83Â in          140Â mm  5.50Â in             6Â in 173Â mm  6.81Â in          159 mm  6.25 in             7 in            198Â mm  7.80Â in          184Â mm  7.25Â in             8Â in 223Â mm  8.78Â in                              </pre>  <p>Unmilled lumber is sold in slightly larger dimensions: 100 mm, 125 mm, 150 mm, and so on.</p>  <p>Studs, joists, and rafters are always spaced 60Â cm (23.62Â in) on center.  The dimensions of OBS and other sheets are multiples of 60Â cm in both dimensions so they can be placed in either direction, e.g., 60 x 240, 60 x 300, or 120 x 300 cm.</p>
513		<p>Here are the EPA guidelines for duct cleaning and when it is necessary.  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/airduct.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/airduct.html</a></p>  <p>Keep in mind that the airflow ducts usually aren't as bad as commercials would have you believe, unless the system was run without an air filter.  The filter usually sits in your air return, which makes sure any air flowing into your supply ducts is "clean".</p>  <p>So, if you see a lot of crap in your supply ducts, you probably have unfiltered air entering the system (hole in a duct maybe).  The other way stuff gets into the supply ducts is from people dropping crap into the floor registers.  If it's dirt in the registers, you can usually get it out by lifting the register and sticking your vacuum cleaner's hose in there.  Just be careful that you don't gouge or hit the sides of the ducts, which can damage them (they can shed fiberglass).</p>  <p>You may have stuff in your return ducts (animal dander, etc), but because of the air filter, this usually doesn't affect the overall air quality in the house much.  The exception would be if you have something in the ducts that the air filter won't trap (mold spores, smelly things).</p>
514	What should I use for a sandbox bottom?	<p>I'm building a sandbox for my three-year old.  It will probably sit on the deck, so it needs some kind of bottom.  Ideally, we should be able to move the sandbox around the deck.  Is it necessary for water to drain out of the sandbox, or will the sand absorb enough water?  What should I use for bottom?</p>  <p>Ideas:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Landscape fabric: allows water to drain through, but may not be strong enough to move.</p></li> <li><p>Regular plywood: allows movement, but may rot and does not drain.</p></li> <li><p>Redwood plywood: I don't know anything about, but I saw it at Home Depot, and it may be more resistant to rot.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Combination: plywood with a few drilled holes, covered by landscape fabric.</p></li> </ul>
515		<p>My yard is of similar size, and I had the same problem: rocks, concrete blocks, and trash.  With no previous experience, I rented a <a href="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/loader/track/22324.html">Toro Dingo</a> with a few different attachments.</p>  <p><img src="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/images/dg22320_34r_bucket_192707_lg.jpg" alt="Toro Dingo"></p>  <p>The attachments I used were:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/loaderattach/ground/23101.html">Soil cultivator</a>.  I used it to till old grass down into the ground, since I was planning to lay new sod.  It tilled grass and weeds far enough into the ground that they did not resurface.</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://www.toro.com/professional/images/lcb_dgo_23101_s_l_lg.jpg" alt="soil cultivator"></p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/loaderattach/ground/23165.html">Leveler</a>.  I used it to, well, level the ground.  As a side effect, it brought rocks and trash to the surface so I could pick it up easily.</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/images/dg22306_34l_level_193133_lg.jpg" alt="leveler"></p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/loaderattach/bucket/22409.html">Standard bucket</a> for enlarging a large hole (in order to bury concrete blocks), moving large concrete blocks and rocks, filling the hole, and otherwise moving larger amounts of dirt.</li> </ul>  <p><img src="http://www.toro.com/professional/images/lcb_dgo_22409_s_r_lg.jpg" alt="standard bucket"></p>  <p>It took me about eight hours for a yard of about the same size as yours.  That included adding 20 cubic yards of new loam on top.  The rental charge was about $400 including delivery and pickup.  It was reasonably easy to make the yard <em>flat</em>, but much harder to make it <em>level</em> because I didn't have any level ground to start from.  If you need your yard to be level, I would recommend hiring someone.</p>
516	Can I have multiple heating zones with a combination boiler?	<p>I bought my first house in December and one thing I've noticed over the winter is higher than expected gas usage which I'd like to try and get down if at all possible. The house is a three bedroom (two plus box room really) semi-detached UK house built in the 30s if thats relevant. The previous owner had recently installed a new <a href="http://www.idealheating.com/products/icos_system_he_homeowner.php" rel="nofollow">Ideal Icos HE24</a> combination boiler but with a standard thermostat and timer.</p>  <p>I'd like to replace the thermostat and timer with two programmable thermostats for upstairs and downstairs and use valves to control heating flow to the two zones. I've seen drawings on the internet showing this using a standalone boiler with separate pumps wtih each zone but am not sure if zones are achievable using combination boilers or whether I'd be placing stress on the boilers internal pump?</p>  <p>My thoughts so far involve one valve for the upstairs flow and one for downstairs flow, from what I've seen I don't need return valves as well?</p>  <p>Working with heating systems isnt something I've done before so I guess I may have some things wrong here but would be interested to hear peoples thoughts.</p>
517		<p>The sand will definitely not absorb/release enough water if it's ever open to the rain. If your box doesn't drain, you'll have a small pond (as we do if we ever forget to put the lid on).</p>  <p>Your landscape fabric idea sounds pretty good. I'd just build that on top of decking slats or something like Trex (which might be perfect for this). Some gaps between the slats will allow drainage. Look into what the decking material is treated with. I'm in the camp that believes that the fears of CCA pressure treated wood are overblown, but even I probably wouldn't use it in a sandbox for a three year old.</p>  <p>Keep in mind regarding sliding it around: Sand is heavy, especially when damp (<a href="http://www.reade.com/Particle_Briefings/spec_gra2.html" rel="nofollow">100-130 pounds per cubic foot</a>). We have a pretty small plastic sandbox in our yard and I can't move it without dumping the sand first (but then "small" to me is something that holds three boys :D and I'm sliding across grass). You might want to think about furniture glides if you can find something that will slide reasonably on your deck, or even castors. Those will require that your base be much more rigid of course.</p>
518		<p>Just thinking off the top of my head maybe a wooden (cypress) frame, put a metal grid across the bottom (maybe some kind of galvanized grid) and brace it with some pieces of cypress. Then put the landscape fabric over the metal grid and then fill with sand.</p>  <p>I almost said go with a straight metal grid but the weight of sand and children would probably be too much so the pieces of cypress would brace across the metal grid. This way you'd get good drainage and the ability to move it around (if you put it on casters).</p>  <p>Not sure how resistant redwood plywood is to rot or if they make cypress plywood.</p>
519	Is basement smell caused by oil boiler?	<p>Although dry and not moldy, my 130-year-old basement has a distinct basement smell that bothers my wife.  I am trying to determine its source.  We have steam heat.  In the summer, the boiler is only used for hot water, of couse.  Do oil boilers usually smell?</p>  <p>The boiler is seven years old.  It was inspected by the oil company and given a clean bill of health when we moved in a few months age.</p>
520	What are the different types of drywall anchors, and what are the advantages of each?	<p>I recently put up wire shelving in my pantry, and spent forever figuring out what type of drywall anchor I should use. I even found several types that I didn't even know existed. It might be good to have a reference page for drywall anchors. So, what type of anchors have you used, and for what projects?</p>
521	What is the practical difference between cement board and greenboard?	<p>When installing tubs I've mostly used cementboard.  I find it a bear to work with though.</p>  <p>A guy I know uses the water resistant greenboard; he claims that for home applications it is entirely adequate.  I've asked at the home center about the difference in reliability, etc. and just gotten shrugs.</p>  <p>Has anyone encountered tub or shower damage where greenboard was used?  Can I switch completely from cementboard to greenboard or are there some applications where I should hesitate?</p>

524		<p>Hard to say without smelling it, but it's likely moisture (even if it's dry) or just poor air circulation.  First thing I would try would be putting a dehumidifier down there to see if that helps.</p>
525		<p>Might want to check out <a href="http://www.fixya.com/support/t941503-gritty_white_film_all_over_dishwasher" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.  Seems like they have a few different ideas:</p>  <ol> <li>CLR (which you already tried)</li> <li>Run vinegar through the dishwasher.</li> <li>Use a different detergent (can vouch for cascade complete here - it's awesome)</li> <li>Use a <a href="http://www.dishwasherfilter.com/" rel="nofollow">special filter/water softener</a>.</li> </ol>
526		<p>As someone with an oil furnace -- when running properly, the smell of an oil furnace shouldn't be significantly noticable.  (although some people are more sensitive than others).</p>  <p>Possible smells from an oil furnace:</p>  <ul> <li>If you have a leak in a fuel tank, or some other spill, it will smell like diesel fuel.</li> <li>If your chimney doesn't draft correctly, you could get smoke inside the house, which leaves a greasy smoke everywhere.  (like the exhaust from a badly maintained diesel vehicle)</li> <li>If you don't get your furnace cleaned and inspected, you can get a condition where it burns hot.  (there was a jet of flame shooting out of the inspection port), which can also get smoke inside the house.</li> <li>If you had water radiators with a circulation pump, if not maintained or it breaks a seal, the wear can cause an oil burning smell</li> </ul>  <p>Luckily, I haven't had the first one -- that took months for my neighbor's basement to vent because their oil company overflowed their tank.  I think there was still a lingering smell for a year, as it had soaked into the concrete.  (the soot thing sucked, too, but once I scrubbed down the walls, it wasn't so bad).</p>
527		<p>Greenboard is water resistant, but should not be used in areas that are going to stay damp, such as tub surrounds.</p>  <p>Once water gets into it (especially if it's not sealed correctly, and there's not the requisite gap between the tub and the wallboard), it will slowly deteriorate and/or mold -- it's water resistant, not water proof.</p>  <p>Yes, cement board is a pain to work with, it's better than having to tear out the whole wall because something was off in the installation of the greenboard.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>All that being said, I believe I've seen some home improvement shows that used greenboard and then waterproof membrane over everything to add an extra layer of water protection when they were doing a shower install (tiling the walls and floor; and there was no tub they were joining up to).</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>You might also want to check with your local government -- it's possible that there might be codes that dictate what you're allowed (or required) to use in shower/tub areas.</p>
528	two condensate drains?	<p>we just had a new AC system installed in my florida house. the unit is in the garage, and the air handler is vertical with the evaporator on top.</p>  <p>the unit he removed had 2 condensate lines: one that drips outside on to the lawn and a second on that points at the floor but never dripped.</p>  <p>the new unit is only connected to the outside drain.</p>  <p>should the new unit have 2 drain lines?</p>
529		<p>No, probably not. The reason there are two lines is in case one gets clogged up, the second one will be used as a backup.  </p>  <p>The reason for the backup line is if the unit is in the house, you absolutely don't want a clog in one drain line to cause water to drip out of the unit and get all over your house.  Since it is in the garage though, it probably just doesn't matter much if you get water on the garage floor.  Which is probably why the installer didn't bother installing a backup line (which it sounds like just drained onto the floor anyways)</p>
530		<p>I worked concrete one summer while I was in high school, but I'm no expert and it was a long time ago. That being said, here's what I would try:</p>  <p>I'd give both of your solutions a shot first. However, if you end up completely destroying the two chips, I'd try to pour a new corner. Drill two holes into the corner of the foundation and dowel into it with a few inches of 3/8" re-bar. After you've hammered in the steel, form up the corner and pour the concrete.</p>  <p>Also, this <a href="http://www.houserepairtalk.com/f17/corner-cracks-3277/" rel="nofollow">forum</a> includes discussion about how to repair similar cracks.</p>  <p>This <a href="http://www.askthebuilder.com/B288_Foundation_Crack_Illustrations.shtml" rel="nofollow">website</a> also explains a bit more about this type of foundation crack:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Brick that is laid directly in contact with concrete foundations can cause angular cracks like this in the top 12 - 16 inches of a foundation. These cracks are caused by the brick expanding and pushing the outer corner of the foundation with it. The cracks are not major structural problems.</p>      <p>It is often pointless to repair them as the next time it gets hot, a crack will likely appear in your repair material.</p> </blockquote>
532		<p><strong>Stud finder.</strong></p>  <p>In case you need to hang something that requires more support than a drywall has.</p>  <p><img src="http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/41/418f6e5c-a1ec-451a-8fc1-b3047f2a7559_300.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
533		<p>I think it mostly comes down to people's expectations.  Everyone expects to be able to flip a switch and the lights come on.  </p>  <p>Home automation systems use something that looks like a switch, but doesn't act like one. That of course confuses people.  If the systems they used looked nothing like switches, people would have different expectations and would treat them differently.</p>
534		<p>One thing that would help would be <strong>standardization of interfaces</strong>. Either through collaboration of the companies in the industry or by one dominating market share and others going copy cat.</p>  <p>A common structure and location of menus, meaning of icons, etc.</p>  <p>It is great to have competition for reasons of pricing, innovation, etc but a familiar interface is what will make it more usable for the average person that just wants it to work.</p>  <p>Look at computers, is Windows the "best" system available? No, but it is the best known, most familiar, and so wins out 9/10 times unless you are dealing with someone with specific needs or a higher interest in computers.</p>  <p>A light switch has a few variations sure, but it is still an extremely simple device, and for the most part you know Up is on and Down is off.</p>  <p>A good example of disparate interfaces are cell phones. I'm a tech guy, you hand me a phone, I can figure it out, but I'm constantly asked by other people when they get a new phone how to do the operations they used to do on the old phone, add contacts, change ringtones, etc.  Apple, Android, Nokia, Samsung, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Motorola are all different user experiences.  For ringtones, one is under Alerts, another Audio, Sound, Notifications, etc.  Menu, Settings, Options, Preferences.  It's like when a manufacturer goes to make a new interface, they pull out another companies phone and a Thesaurus and just pick different words.  People will deal with cracked screens, poor reception, short battery life, etc just to avoid having to learn a new phone.</p>

Get it too big and the anchor doesn't do its job.</p>  <p>To get them to hold well, you have to get the perfect size hole.</p>
536		<p>I am not an expert on the subject, but when we were buying our house, inspector noted that heating system has three separate pumps for the three zones. He said, that it was "nice", and "more reliable then a single pump". From this I draw a conclusion that it is possible to run multiple zones off of a single pump, but you probably want to avoid doing that.</p>
537	Wood for boarding a loft?	<p>I want to board out my loft - just for easy storage of things like tools, boxes, old clothes, suitcases, small unused furtniture etc (i.e. nothing too heavy). I am wondering what kind of boards to buy for this purpose. Most of the boards I see advertised for doing this are chipboard, but they also vary widely in price. What's the recommended approach considering I want it to last for 10 years or more?</p>
538		<p><a href="http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html">This article</a> has a beautiful summary of the different types of anchors.</p>
539	What are the pros and cons of different types of windows?	<p>I live in the North Eastern corner of US, and my house has 50 year old single-pane wooden windows. They held up not too bad, considering, but now I want to replace them all. Things that are important to me are:</p>  <ul> <li>Decent energy efficiency (this, hopefully, is easy to judge -- the numbers are "printed on the box")</li> <li>Durability (this is a tough one to know up front. All I know is that I hate broken seals)</li> <li>Maintenance free-ness </li> <li>Not astronomically expensive.</li> </ul>  <p>Coming from the IT world, I usually obsess with specs and numbers, and new shiny things tend to excite me -- after reading various stuff online for a bit, my thinking goes: "vinyl is cheap for a reason, wood is nice looking but requires maintenance, and fiberglass is where it's at!" But is it even the right approach? Should I stop obsessing about technology, and instead focus on finding a great manufacturer (under the assumption that great vinyl window will live longer then an average fiberglass one). </p>  <p>I guess my actual questions are:</p>  <p>Is window technology important? And if it is, then what's good?  What are the good window manufacturers? What else am I missing (let's talk about just picking the right windows, and not even start on installation)</p>
540		<p>My storage attic is just some plywood sheets over the rafters/insulation. Just nailed them right to the ceiling joists. My attic probably isn't as large as your loft but if you're not looking to make a living space out of it the plywood should probably be fine for you.</p>
541		<p>Since you are going to place it on a deck, move it around, want to keep water and cats out, I would just buy a plastic one with a lid.  In my opinion its not worth the hassle.  The wood alone will make it heavy and hard to move around, let alone with sand in it.  </p>  <p>They are fairly cheap, we bought one a few weeks ago at a garage sale for $5.  I know there is pride in doing it yourself, I wanted to build one too, but in the end, it may not be worth it.  </p>
542	Why are my deck boards of uneven width?	<p>I bought 12-foot-long 5/4 x 6 in pressure-treated pine deck board from Home Depot.  Not until I laid them down did I notice that the boards' width tapers significantly toward the ends of each board.  See the picture below.  My deck is finished (as of last nightâyay!), but just so I know for next time: is this kind of variation in width something I have to expect?  Or was I just unlucky with what Home Depot had this week?  Or can I avoid this buy shopping elsewhere?</p>  <p><img src="http://www.ljosa.com/diy/deck-boards-uneven-width.jpg" alt="Deck boards of uneven width"></p>
543		<p>As Scott mentioned, plywood will probably be fine.  I just used 1/2 inch plywood in mine.  I would probably recommend you use "real" plywood though rather than the chipboard stuff.  It's a bit more expensive, but also much more durable if you're going to be walking on it.</p>  <p>One thing to think about (that I didn't) is that if you are in a cold climate you'll typically want the insulation in the loft to come up several inches over the tops of the floor joists (assuming blown in insulation here).  If that's the case, you may not be able to attach the plywood directly to the joists without compressing the insulation (which is not good).</p>
544		<p>The reason copper gas pipes are soldered with silver solder is the melting temperature is much higher. This is done in case your house catches on fire, normal solder would melt and you would have a blow-torch helping burn down your house.</p>
545		<p>I've never noticed that before, but Home Depot sources their lumber from different mills, so they may vary slightly from batch to batch.  It may also even out a bit as the wood dries.</p>  <p>One thing I did find, at least in my area, is that the 5/4 deck boards from Home Depot are significantly different than the ones at Lowes.  The Lowes ones are slightly narrower but a bit thicker and the depot ones are thinner but slightly wider.  Was very annoying when I got some boards from one place and more later from another only to find that they weren't really the same dimensions.</p>
546	How do I sand stamps off of lumber?	<p>I just finished building a deck.  The boards have stamps 1â2 ft from each end, and I could not bring my self to be as wasteful as to always cut them off.  I tried to place the boards with the stamp down when possible, but the mill seemed to have taken special care to place the stamp on the âgoodâ (undamaged) side of most boards.  Here is a picture:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.ljosa.com/diy/deck-stamp.jpg" alt="deck stamp"></p>  <p>I probably have 30â50 of these stamps to sand off.  How easily do they come offâis it too much to do by hand, using a block and sandpaper, given that I have no ambition of becoming the next <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/" rel="nofollow">Karate Kid</a>?  If so, I will have to convince my wife to let me buy another powertool. :)  Should I get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_sander" rel="nofollow">belt sander</a>, or will a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_orbital_sander" rel="nofollow">random-orbit sander</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=mouse+sander&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=a-FOTPPxJsP88Aba6pTlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDsQrQQwAA" rel="nofollow">Mouse</a> be sufficient for this job?  (The latter two would be more useful for future indoor projects.)</p>
547		<p>If you can get under your deck I'd try and do a test sanding just using sandpaper and some arm strength to see how easy the stamps come off. I'd be willing to bet a small orbital sander would do the trick with some fine grit paper.</p>  <p>Orbital sanders are pretty cheap so convincing the wife shouldn't be too much trouble. Maybe hop on craigslist or ebay and see if ya snag one on the cheap.</p>
548		<p>For occassional storage chipboard or any plywood 1/2" or greater will be fine.  Go to 5/8 minimum if your joists are on 2' centers.</p>  <p>I personally don't agree with the advice to use plywood. Chipboard is fine: it's strong, and it's made using waste materials so it's more ecologically sound to use it where it's appropriate.  It's <em>not</em> appropriate for applications that are exposed to the elements in any way: in those cases plywood is more durable so justifies the 2x cost and the extra environmental impact.</p>  <p>Chipboard does have a strength axis, which you might as well take advantage of it: you want the joists running across the short side, i.e. 5 joists on every 4x8 sheet if the joists are on 2' centers.</p>  <p>Chipboard made for flooring has a tongue-and-groove along the long side.  That's because while the short sides are supported by the joists, the long sides bridge the joists.  Locking a tongue into a groove prevents sagging between the floor joists.  Obviously not a big deal for you storage loft, but if it only costs a few more bucks for the tongue-and-groove I'd get that.  I've only seen that in 3/4" and 1", BTW, so if you get that you'll have a proper floor up there that you could hold a neighborhood dance on.</p>
549	Does decking board orientation really matter?	<p>I've been told that decking boards should always be installed "bark side up" so that the boards crown (and shed water) as they age rather than cup  (and collect water).  But then I've also heard that it should be done the other way around.  And I've also heard that it just doesn't matter one way or the other - just put the "nicest" side up.</p>  <p>So, which way is best, or doesn't it matter at all?</p>
550	Crack spanning several tiles	<p>I've got several tiles in my dining room that have a diagonal crack running across them. Since it's a pretty straight line across several tiles, I'm guessing it's a foundation issue. The room is at the corner of the house, and the crack runs diagonally so that it "cuts off" the corner. If I replace the tiles, is it likely to crack again? Is there any way I can remedy this?</p>
551		<p>In my experience with X10, the number 1 problem is the <strong>reliability of signal</strong>. Yes, there's the complexity of setup, etc. But most of these don't impact people very much. You set it up once; it's fine for a very long time. But it's the randomness of behavior that causes the real frustration with home automation. Sometimes things just don't work, or they work with a strange delay, or lights magically turn themselves off.</p>  <p>The solution to this, IMO, is to transmit data on a data line rather than trying to transmit over power (flakey) or RF (range problems). If power cables included a twisted pair for data, that would make a huge difference in my opinion. It would also get rid of the need for X10 devices to draw small amounts of power even when off, which screws up CF bulbs which hate being fed small amounts of choppy power and flicker terribly on X10 circuits if there isn't an incandescent in the loop. The trick to this is that you'd need a very good way to continue the twisted pairs at junctions that didn't use them. In practice, I think the solution for this would be a new style of electrical gang box.</p>  <p><strong>The non-technical members of my household actually love the home automation.</strong> I've been able to tie light switches together that were a pain to use, put wireless light switches across the room where they're useful, and let you turn out all the downstairs lights with a single button in the bedroom. When it works, they love it. But they'd love it a lot more if the house were wired for it from the start, and it were just configured well as part of building the house.</p>
552		<p>Depends on how old your house is.  If it's at least 5-10 years old or so, it's probably finished settling and installing new tiles would likely fix the problem permanently.</p>
553		<p>I was curious if you could wash those off and found an article that has four different ways to wash off stamp ink: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5185607_remove-ink-stamp-wood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_5185607_remove-ink-stamp-wood.html</a>.</p>  <p>Of course this is talking about stamp pad ink but I would try one of these to see if you could get the ink out first before going to sanding it (sanding could be visible if you are not very careful).</p>
554		<p>I would say crown side up and shed water. The deck that was on my house when I bought it was cup side up and is in horrible shape. That could be from the fact that the people never took care of it but being in a rather wet/snowy climate didn't help. I'm sure pooled water of any kind can't be good, even on treated wood.</p>
555		<p>Instead of trying to fix the crack, first try figuring out what is causing the crack.  You can fix a crack many times, but if you are fighting against something like water pressure (or one of the many other causes of cracks in concrete), you will never win.   Once you find what is causing the crack, then look to mitigate the problem somehow (proper drainage in the case of water buildup), and then fixing it one final time will take care of the problem.  </p>
556	New Concrete Patio Options	<p>We would like to put in a new concrete patio.  We are looking at a stamped concrete patio for durability and visual appeal.  What other options are there?  What are the pros and cons of the different options?</p>  <p>In addition, what about staining concrete?  What is the durability?  Does it need to be reapplied? </p>
557		<p>Depending on your location mold build-up (in addition to the dust mentioned by others), can be a big reason to clean the ducts.  Areas with high humidity can grow impressive mold collections, particularly on systems that have humidifiers as well.</p>
558	Where can I find central heating system with radiators?	<p>Coming from Europe, I am used to radiator heating systems and thinking about putting one into a fixer-upper house I intend to buy. Where can I find such a system in the North-American market?</p>
559		<p>You should be able to find them in any of the original colonies in colder climates, as they're needed for restoration work in older homes.  (so, eastern seaboard, from Maryland to the north)</p>  <p>American radiators tend to be heavy steel or iron and gravity fed, with larger pipes that I don't believe are as efficient as those found in areas like Germany.  My neighbors are currently going through a remodel of their home (1940s construction, in Maryland) got theirs from an architectural salvage place.  The burners (oil in their case, and in my home), you can still get new so are easier to replace.</p>  <p>Contact your local plumbing supply store; if they can't tell you where to find radiators, their customers (plumbers &amp; pipe fitters) might be able to.</p>  <p>You might also find the 'baseboard heating' where there's a copper pipe with fins attached that run along the whole wall of a room.  If you just want the non-drying qualities of radiator heat but can't find radiators in your area, this might be an alternative.  (I've never seen fan-assisted models in the US, either, but I'm guessing if they have them, it'd be in the northeast.</p>
560		<p>Typical early style radiator heat is nothing like modern European style radiators.  You should find out what originally came with the house to make the best fit.  There is steam heat, water heat.  The boiler may be powered by oil, natural gas, or (if it's really old) coal.  As Joe mentioned, the radiators can be gravity powered or propelled with a circulation pump.  The gravity fed systems use large cast iron pipes down to the boiler and is less efficient.  A circulation pump feed system uses smaller pipes and is more efficient, but you probably wouldn't want to retrofit a pump on a gravity fed system without changing out the pipes.</p>  <p>I've seen a This Old House episode where Tom placed a European style thermostat on a standard water filled radiator.  So, this may be an option for you.</p>
562	How to replace a bath tub	<p>Our 30-year-old home as a 30-year-old yellow cast-iron tub that's gross.</p>  <p>What's the best way to go about swapping it out for a modern plastic or acryllic one? It's currently set into the wall by about 1cm on two sites (the front where the taps and drains are and on the long side) and it has brickwork has been built up on the 3rd side to match the height and make a small shelf, which has then been tiled.</p>  <p>The new baths we're looking at are almost the exact same length and depth, but they're slightly shallower (height).</p>
563		<p>Honestly, It can be a giant pain in the butt.  </p>  <p>You start with covering it with a thick blanket or two and smashing it with a sledgehammer to bust it up into pieces (yeah, that's really how it's done).  The blanket is to prevent getting yourself cut up by flying pieces of cast iron and porcelain.  You might also have to bust out the tile/brickwork as well, depending on how things fit together.</p>  <p>To get the new tub in, you might just be able to get it in the door, but many bathroom doors in older houses are of the 24" variety and you can't fit a tub through them - especially if it's a one piece shower/tub system.  If that's the case you will probably need to take the door out, cut out a stud on one side and bust up the wall a bit to get the new unit in.  Then of course rebuild it all once you got the new tub in.</p>  <p>I would strongly consider re-glazing your existing tub.  It can really make a crappy old tub look like brand new.</p>
564	What can I use to hang a frameless mirror?	<p>I'm looking to hang a mirror on the wall on my bathroom. It weighs about 20 or so lbs. There are no built in hooks on the back of the mirror? What should I use to hang this thing?</p>
565		<p><a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=39" rel="nofollow">Liquid Nails Mirror Adhesive</a>, but it does say you need to use a mechanical support as well, such as a shelf angle or "J" channel.</p>  <p>Another option is <a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=36" rel="nofollow">Heavy Duty Construction Adhesive</a> which will hold about anything. In our new house, we installed large, frameless mirrors in each bathroom using this and it worked great.</p>  <h1>UPDATE</h1>  <p>As Alex pointed out in the comments, the site for Heavy Duty Construction Adhesive does not recommend using it for mirrors. They do have two other products that are specifically for mirrors, <a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=39" rel="nofollow">Mirror Adhesive (LN-930)</a> and <a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=83" rel="nofollow">Mirror Adhesive (LOW-VOC) (LN-730)</a></p>
566		<p>It didn't come with anything? The one 'frameless' mirror that I have is in the dining room, and it's probably 30 lbs, but it has a wooden frame behind it and a set of small metal clips that go over the edge onto the front of the mirror and then screw into the wooden frame. It really doesn't change the look, but it supports the whole thing very nicely. </p>  <p>I'd try to do something similar with another frameless mirror.</p>
567		<p>It sounds like you're using keypads to control sets of lights. Two important things:</p>  <p><strong>Label the buttons well</strong> and <strong>Keep it simple and consistent</strong>.</p>  <p>For example, if you're using scenes, have the buttons say the name of a scene that makes sense, depending on the location. If there's a keypad in the hallway outside the kitchen in the living room, make sure it's clear which scenes control the kitchen, and which control the living room. Also, if you're using scenes, avoid mixing button types; eg, having "dim" and "bright" buttons in addition to scenes is confusing.</p>  <p>I'd also echo @Rob Napier's point that reliability is a huge factor. If you press a button and it "sometimes" works, it will just lead to frustration (in effect: don't use X10). </p>  <p>Also along the lines of being consistent, pick one or two different types of switches, and stick to those. If you have a mix of toggle switches, rocker dimmers, 6-button and 8-button keypads, it's just going to be confusing. Standardize on a manufacturer and style, and stick to it.</p>  <p>The other obvious thing is really <strong>talk to your users</strong>. Make sure you know what they typically do, and adjust the system appropriately. Maybe they always go into a room and want a certain light on at a certain level, but you never do .. make sure you talk to that person so you know to set it up so it works they way they expect. </p>
568	What is the proper way to install/paint baseboard?	<p>I've installed some new baseboards, though I'm not really sure I have the right method down. Here's what I do: </p>  <ol> <li>Paint baseboard</li> <li>Paint walls</li> <li>Cut and install baseboard (using brad nailer and/or liquid nails)</li> <li>Sand outside corners so they're not as pointy</li> <li>Go over nail holes and straight joins with putty, and seal corners with caulk</li> <li>Sand putty with high grit (just to smooth it out)</li> <li>Touch-up paint on all the putty/caulk</li> </ol>  <p>The downside of this method is that there is a (in some places) small but noticeable gap between the top of the baseboard and the wall. Pretty much anywhere if you wanted to, you could push a piece of paper behind the baseboard. Most new construction I've seen doesn't have this gap, and generally if the walls/trim is re-painted at some point, that also seals up the gap. </p>  <p>Is there a step I'm skipping where people caulk the top edge all the way around? Or am I doing this completely wrong?</p>
569	Can a bathroom vanity be installed higher than 30 inches?	<p>"Standard" bathroom vanities are 30", where as kitchen counter tops are typically 36". </p>  <p>For me (6' tall), the 30" vanity is rather low. Is there any reason to leave vanities that height, or can they be installed higher? Is there any practical downside to having a higher vanity (eg, kids)? </p>
570		<p>At Home Depot (or Lowes) you should be able to find these <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/buy/bath-bath-mirrors-mirror-framing-kits/erias-home-decor-astoria-spring-loaded-mirror-clips-4-pack-193546.html" rel="nofollow">Spring Loaded Mirror Mounting Clips</a> made specially for hanging a mirror.  They are no where near as big as a j channel and the top two have a small spring inside of them so they kind of grasp the mirror (and snugly fit on the glass).  </p>  <p>You put the two without the springs in the bottom and the mirror just sits in them.  Two more (with the springs) added to the top prevent the mirror from falling forward.  Of course it would be best if you can get them into a beam in your wall.  And you will barely notice the clips on the mirror once it is in place.</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wMI8u.jpg" alt="Mirror mounting clips"></p>
571		<p>I recently re-trimmed my closet door and there was a slight gap at the top thanks to shifting or settling. I nailed up the trim and then used <a href="http://www.elmers.com/products/sealants-and-compounds/multi-purpose" rel="nofollow">Elmer's white wood putty</a> to fill in the gap. It comes in a variety of colors and paints over really well. Easy to spread out as well, I just used my finger to smooth over the gap and after a little paint you can't even tell it's there.</p>  <p>I wouldn't consider it a "step" in installing baseboard, you probably just have a slight defect or warp in either the baseboard or wall. Just one of life's little things.</p>
572		<p>The baseboard in my house is white so when I have had to replace/remove some I find the original builder had put caulk along the top.  So when I put it back, I too add a line of caulk along the top edge to fill in any gaps and I also think it really gives it that finished look.  Of course this would not work as well if your baseboard is not white (and probably I would not recommend doing it then).</p>
573		<p>You could make them as tall as you like, but you may run into problems when it comes time to sell.  Also as you mentioned kids may have trouble using them, and would need taller step stools.</p>
574		<p>If the gap is not too large I would just leave it.  If the gap is noticeable and bothers you I would remove the baseboard and trim/sand out anything behind it that is holding it away from the wall, keep in mind you may still have slight gaps in places where the wall or baseboard are not perfectly straight.</p>  <p>You could also install the baseboard at a very slight angle (using shims) so that the top touches the wall leaving no gap, but the bottom is out a very small amount.  make sure the angle is very slight otherwise it will be noticeable, but for the most part nobody will notice a slight angle on the baseboard.</p>  <p>The only place I would use caulk on top of a baseboard is in the bathroom/kitchen, just to make sure water stays out from behind the baseboard.</p>
575		<p>If you are doing a double sink, I've seen in some homes where one portion of the vanity counter is raised.</p>  <p>That way you have the normal height for the not so tall and a raised height for us normal people :).</p>  <p>Being 6' also, I saw that and thought "I will have that in my house", having the counter half way between your knees and waist gets very annoying...</p>
576		<p>You would usually caulk the gap between the baseboard and the wall.  This is why I usually don't bother painting the trim before putting it up (unless I'm staining it).</p>  <p>Usually I would prime the wall first, then put up the trim, putty/caulk, paint the trim, then finally paint the walls.</p>
577		<p>Removing the sheetrock will lower the finished stool height a bit which will help maintain a more even reveal on the window, and  make it look less like the stool was added on.  Cut around the edges first with a utility knife to minimize damage to the surrounding jambs &amp; wall below and then just pry it up.  </p>  <p>If you really want to keep the same reveal as the old sheetrock, you could build up your new stool out of 1/2" thick stock (assuming the sheetrock was 1/2").  Make one piece that is the size and shape of the entire stool, then thicken it where it projects out from the wall by laminating another 1/2" thick piece underneath.</p>
578	What could cause a ground/soil smell on the first floor?	<p>My house is on a slab (no basement, no crawl space) and every summer when it gets hot and humid i am getting a ground/soil smell in our living room. First i was blaming it on the absence of the basement but now realized that i only get this smell in one room. The only difference about that room is that it has a lawn along one wall and a flower bed along another.</p>  <p>Can that be a reason? Maybe i should pave a foot of space along that wall.</p>  <p>What else can cause it?</p>
579		<p>While I was house shopping at the beginning of the year, I saw several houses that had his and hers vanities, with the 'his' (also known as 'shaving height') vanity several inches higher than the 'hers' vanity. The height for a shaving vanity ranges from 34-36", while the 'hers' vanity is the standard 30." This <a href="http://www.city-data.com/forum/san-antonio/382824-bathroom-vanity-height.html" rel="nofollow">forum</a> also discusses the topic.</p>
580		<p>I've seen lots of houses that use standard kitchen cabinets as a master bath vanity -- around here at least it's considered an upgrade.  A 36" height is not uncomfortably tall for anyone but small children (which is why they're only used in the master bath).  My wife is 5'2" and loved the 36" double vanity in our old house.</p>
581		<p><strong>A Block Plane</strong></p>  <p>Fits in a toolbelt or toolbox.  Comes out every time something <em>almost</em> fits. Saves eight million trips back to the table saw.

582		<p>I just installed baseboard through my entire house.  I caulked the top of the baseboard, as you are thinking.</p>  <p>I used a paintable silicone caulk, like <a href="http://www.dap.com/product_details.aspx?BrandID=14&amp;SubcatID=3">DAP Dynaflex</a>. Once it dried, I went back with a detail brush and painted the caulk the color of the baseboard.</p>  <p>It's a few extra hours of work, but it looks great.</p>  <p>Our painter did a couple rooms, and this is how he did it as well.</p>  <p>Other than that, I think you have the process down.  The reason you paint first is so that you can roll on the paint in long sections.  Trust me, painting the baseboard after installation is crazy.  Also, painting after cutting the baseboard takes <em>a lot</em> longer than painting the entire strip of baseboard prior to cutting.</p>
583	I need to clean and reseal my dock, most sealers don't mention if they are safe to use over water	<p>I have a wood dock over a lake.  It is time to clean and seal the dock.  I am planning on pressure washing the dock first, then I am planning to have a clear seal.  Looking at products in Lowe's and Depot I can't determine what is safe to use. I don't want it to look like a BP spill or kill any life forms.</p>
584	How can I speed up my slow hot water?	<p>Our water heater (gas) is located in the garage. It is 25 to 30 feet away from the closest faucet, which I'm guessing is the main reason it takes so long -- a minute or longer -- to get hot water flowing into my house.</p>  <p>What can I do to reduce the time it takes to get hot water flowing?</p>
585		<p>Insulate the hot water pipes from the hot water heater to the faucet.  Hopefully you have access to them in your crawl space.</p>
586		<p>You can go for a small water heater right near the faucet.  I have done this with small 8 litre water heaters in the kitchen and guest toilets rather than linking them to the main water heater.</p>
587		<p>One option is a recirculating water pump, which can pump hot water into the pipes based on various triggers (on demand, based on a timer, based on water temp, etc depending on model). I used one at my previous house, and it worked pretty well. There's more info here:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.askthebuilder.com/413_Hot_Water_Recirculating_Pumps.shtml">http://www.askthebuilder.com/413_Hot_Water_Recirculating_Pumps.shtml</a></p>
588		<p>Install a hot water recirculating pump.  Older pumps required that the house be plumbed with a return loop to support circulation, but newer designs can be retrofitted if a house wasn't plumbed that way. </p>  <p>More info: <a href="http://www.askthebuilder.com/413_Hot_Water_Recirculating_Pumps.shtml">http://www.askthebuilder.com/413_Hot_Water_Recirculating_Pumps.shtml</a></p>  <p>$ saving tip: put the pump on a timer and have it come on only when you typically use hot water at that location. Or use an X-10 switched outlet (or something similar) to allow remote manual switching combined with timed events.</p>
589		<p>They do make stain <a href="http://saversystems.com/wood-products/marine-seal-wood-dock-stain" rel="nofollow">specifically for marine use</a>.  Doesn't say specifically that it's environmentally friendly, but the MSDS sheet does say it's water soluble.  The same manufacturer has <a href="http://saversystems.com/wood-products/uv-resistant-clear-finish" rel="nofollow">environmentally friendly stains</a> as well, but I have no idea how well they might work (or exactly what "environmentally friendly" means to them).</p>
590		<p>The best way to speed up hot water to the tap is through the use of a booster heater, also known as a "point of use" hot water heater. This is a small (~4 gallon) hot water heater installed very near the sink. If you need a lot of hot water and you want it to start fast you can install the hot water line as the supply for the point of use heater. That way you will have 4 gallons for immediate use and if you use that up you will be drawing hot water from your main hot water heater. If you don't need more than 4 gallons of hot water at the sink you can just use cold water as the supply. Here's an <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006GVO1C">example of a point of use water heater for sale at Amazon.com</a>. </p>
591		<p>There really isn't a perfect solution to slow-flowing water, other than carefully planning your home so that the water heater is as close to the faucets as possible.</p>  <p>As <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/a/588/188">stated by Josh</a>, one solution is water recirculation. But depending on usage scenarios, water recirculation can waste a lot of energy. "Sense" technology that enables recirculation when needed can improve efficiency. And installing a system that uses the "cold" water circuit as a return line can make installation relatively easy.</p>  <p>If all else has failed, you can try quickly opening and closing the hot water - forcing the system to kick in. Wait a minute or so, and when you open again, you'll have hot water (and you will have saved a minute of running water).</p>  <p>Another solution is the <b>instant water heater</b>, like <a href="http://www.clage.com/energiesparen/produktvergleiche/index.php" rel="nofollow">this one produced by Clage</a>. It works by heating right next to the faucets. On-demand water heaters are quite efficient for usual "short burst" operation.</p>
592		<p>As long as the boiler is capable of providing enough hot water through the system to heat the whole house if necessary you shouldn't have a problem.</p>  <p>What you are proposing is a "coarser" version of thermostatic valves on each radiator and that is perfectly safe for a combination boiler.</p>  <p>I don't think you need return valves.</p>  <p>Make sure that you leave one radiator "open" (usually the bathroom one) so that there is some flow around the circuit.</p>  <p>By the way the fact that it's a combination boiler is a red herring. The "combi" bit refers to the hot water heater, the central heating aspect is pretty much the same as a "standard" boiler with integral pump.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong></p>  <p>If you want to control the times each room is heated independently you can get combined timer and thermostatic radiator valves - <a href="http://www.mygreenerhome.co.uk/heat-saving-48/heating-controls-51/househeat-saver-pack-265.html" rel="nofollow">My Greener Home</a> has some for example.</p>
593	Humidity Levels	<p>What is a healthy and safe humidity level that I should try to keep my house at?</p>
594	Should I apply car wax to the outside of my air conditioning unit?	<p>Through different conversations with family members and friends, I have been told that it is good to apply a coat of car wax to the outside of the air conditioning unit frame. I assume that this is to maintain a protective seal and prevent corrosion. Has anyone done this before? I just bought a new Trane XR15 unit in April and I want to keep it in tip-top shape for as long as possible.</p>
595	How do I hang shelves on poor quality brick/concrete walls?	<p>I'm trying to install some shelves in my apartment (brick/concrete) but when I drill holes the walls almost seem like they're made of sand. I'm not able to securely fix the screws (I'm using wall plugs) and the shelves appear like they're going to fall down at any minute.</p>  <p>Is there anything I can do about it? I was wondering if I could use some material inside the holes after I drill them (and before putting the wall plugs) so I can make the screws stay firm in their place.</p>  <p>Any tips?</p>
596		<p>It's probably worth it if you are running new pipes or the existing pipes are easily accessible, but if you have to lift boards etc. to gain access probably not.</p>
597		<p>You can use different fittings, such as frame fixings (the kind of thing you'd use to hold a exterior door frame or window in it's hole).  Also, you could fix up a batten with lots and lots of long rawlplugs and fat screws (two rawlplugs per hole, one deeper so the whole screw is biting into rawlplug), then screw your shelves to that nice study wood batten.</p>
598		<p>If you have a drainage issue, or you're likely to have freezing conditions, I'd personally want to lay a small coating of gravel across the concrete first - allow that pent-up water to get out of the way.</p>  <p>If you're building this in, say, Phoenix, though, that may not really matter and laying them directly atop the concrete shouldn't be a problem.</p>  <p>To the 'cement' part of your question: why not go with dry-laid? As long as there is some form of rim to the patio, or you're not driving over them, dry-laying would make both maintenance and modification easier.</p>
599		<p>Are you sure you are not drilling between the mortar? That is the weakest point to drill.</p>  <p>There are a couple different things you can do. I assume you are using concrete anchors so you can apply a generous coating of <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_40301-69-1405605_0_?productId=3203637&amp;Ntt=loctite+concrete&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=/pl__0__s?newSearch=true%24Ntt=loctite%20concrete%24y=0%24x=0">Loctite Metal and Concrete Epoxy</a> onto the anchor before you insert it into the hole. </p>  <p>The other option is to take furring strips (pressure treated 1x4's) and attach them to the wall with blue concrete anchor screws, at least 2 and 1/2 inches long. These should make a good thread and the furring strips will add to the support structure. Space your anchors 2-4 inches apart vertically and on-center.</p>
600		<p>In the winter it is 30 to 40 percent in cold climates.  During the summer, indoor humidity levels should be kept below about 65 percent to minimize the potential for mold growth and below about 50 percent to minimize dust mites.</p>  <p>See this article for some more great information on humidity levels: <a href="http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/structu/ae1204w.htm">Keep Your Home Healthy</a></p>
601		<p>A better solution might be to build a framework to support the shelves rather than trying to "bodge" (as we say in the UK) the holes. What you need to do is spread the load from the shelves over a larger area.</p>  <p>Without knowing the layout of your walls it's difficult to suggest anything definite but if you had an alcove you could fix vertical battens up the sides and then hang the shelves between those.</p>  <p>Another alternative is to use a glue such as "No Nails", however, you need to check that it's suitable for your walls and can handle the load.</p>
602	What should I keep in mind when altering the drainage around my basement?	<p>My back yard has some wet spots near the corner of my house. Because of property lines, fences, and window wells for my basement, it's hard to dramatically change the surface drainage of the area. I'm considering putting in a plastic drain box and perforated pipe that will tie into the storm sewer system. </p>  <p>What things should I be careful of when doing this? Should I consider just doing a French drain which does not tie into the storm sewer? Should I dig a trench, line with small rock, then lay in the corrugated, perforated pipe? </p>  <p>I'd really hate to do all the work of burying the pipe only to discover I didn't do it right. </p>
603		<p>The lower end stuff is crap, and will drive you mad over time. This includes X-10, Insteon, and UPB. These products <strong>will</strong> fail. It's just a question of how long before they do. Z-Wave is a technology, not a product line.</p>  <p>If you want something complete and reliable, go for Lutron RadioRA. Version 2 of this industry-standard system was released recently, and prices have become more reasonable. This is a whole-house solution. They also offer single-room and smaller-scene packages, and the mother-load solution called HomeWorks, which pretty much rules out retrofitting.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.lutron.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lutron.com</a></p>  <p>Note that you'll want a pro to install and configure these switches, unless you're really geeky and comfortable with handling electricity. And single.</p>  <p>Edit: Here is a link to a discussion about this very thing on a pro site.

604		<p><strong>Planning Permission</strong> determines whether you are <strong>allowed</strong> to make the change. The <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/Planning/PlanningPermission/index.htm" rel="nofollow">DirectGov site</a> has information about when you need to apply. You need planning permission <strong>before</strong> you start building - ideally before you hire a builder. You will need architects plans to obtain permission.</p>  <p>It is possible to get planning permission retrospectively, but don't rely on this. If you fail you <strong>will</strong> have to demolish your extension/building and restore the site.</p>  <p><strong>Building Regulations</strong> determine whether what you <strong>have</strong> built is legal (safety, insulation etc.). There's some information on the Government's <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/" rel="nofollow">Communities site</a></p>  <p>An inspector will visit your site at regular intervals or by appointment during the build to check that each stage meets the regulations. Work shouldn't start on the next stage until this has happened as you might have to redo aspects which would be a waste of time and money.</p>  <p>Some types/size of building/extension don't need planning permission, but will need to pass inspection. The exemptions will depend on where you are.</p>  <p>This is probably one of those cases where quoting from the linked pages is a bad idea as these can and do change quite frequently and there may be local regulations which supersede the national ones (Conservation areas for example).</p>
605	Does a software-controlled central heating programmer and thermostat exist?	<p>I have a central heating programmer in the airing cupboard (where the hot water tank is).  It allows a couple of separate schedules for water and heating separately, and also for manual override when needed.</p>  <p>The thermostat is in the hallway by the front door.</p>  <p>I'd like to replace this kit with a basic bare-bones system that would allow an application on my Windows PC to control it.  I'm a software developer, so it's a hobby project and I don't necessarily need a totally complete solution from a single vendor.</p>  <p>I'm thinking of something which is little more than relays on a TCP/IP-enabled PCB.</p>  <p>Anyone have any recommendations?</p>
606	Electric Fireplace worth it	<p>The wife is bent on getting an Electric heater for the living room.  We opted not to purchase the gas fireplace when we built our home (through Ryan).  She claims these things can cost up to $1000.</p>  <p>She has a guy on craigslist thats trying to get rid of his for &lt; $200.  Says he bought it preparing to install it and they moved to a new home w/ a fireplace before he could.</p>  <p>Will this improve the value of my home?</p>
607		<p>I just answered a similar question about lighting automation options <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/384/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-different-types-of-smart-switches-that-are-on-the/603#603">here</a>. If you're going to be in a home for a while, invest in something that won't drive you crazy. RadioRA is controllable by just about every third party home automation system.</p>
608		<p>If you are not in a freezing condition, then the only other problem I see is that the pavers will shift on top of the concrete pad. Gravel would make that worse. You are going to have to brace the pavers to keep them from shifting.</p>
609		<p>This is very likely a drainage issue. I would check the following things:</p>  <ol> <li>Does water drain away from the house near this room?</li> <li>Are plants growing right up next to the foundation?</li> </ol>  <p>You might want to put a buffer of 10" of rock (4-6" deep) next to the house. </p>  <p>Since the house has vinyl siding you need to peek under the siding and see if you have moisture collecting under the siding. Spray the side of the house gently with water or go out after a rain and pull back some of your siding and check for water seepage. The smell could be the result of smells outside but it could be moisture in the walls. </p>  <p>The cinder blocks can also be an issue. Concrete holds a surprising amount of moisture. In addition to the things mentioned above, you likely would benefit from a dehumidifier in this room. Check the humidity with a cheap humidity tester and if the room is over 65% humidity you should consider dehumidifying. </p>
610		<p><strong>A Picquic.</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O53e8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>[I would have left this as a comment on the screwdriver-set answer, but I don't have sufficient rep.]</p>  <p>If you're in Canada, the one tool I'd recommend above any other is the standard Picquic combination screwdriver. <a href="http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_detail.jsp;jsessionid=MQKVpQskSm3ntd7n8SnpnRtS2D3jvpztLLkL4n9RGGzwvQzKDY9J!1040220845?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443290588&amp;bmUID=1280346645699" rel="nofollow">Canadian Tire's page</a> is probably the best example -- judging by the reviews, I'm not the only one who loves it. :)</p>  <p>I've used mine for years, on almost every job I've done around the house. In a pinch, the bits also fit well into a cordless drill. There are probably good equivalents in other countries, though I've not run across any myself.</p>
611		<p>Liquid aerification doesn't really sound like a good idea to me, but I quite honestly know nothing about it.</p>  <p>What I'd do: Rent an aerator, spread compost and/or some good fertilizer, and water the yard. Repeat at least once a year. If you don't have any grass growing currently, bring in some compost and mix it in with the existing soil with a tiller (or something bigger).</p>
612		<p>If properly installed, I can't see why it wouldn't increase the value of your home by more than the $200 you paid for it.  You also need to think beyond just resale and consider the value you (or your wife) gets by having it as well.</p>
613	What are the black spots on my bathroom ceiling? Are they mold?	<p>My bathroom above my tub is getting some black spots on it that seems to be growing. I assume it's mold. I am wondering how should I deal with this? What should I expect it to cost?</p>
614		<p>I've never heard of this before.  Does it mention anything about doing that in the maintenance guide for your unit?  If not, then I probably wouldn't bother.</p>
615		<p>I've only done the french drain thing; I have no idea what would be required with tying into a storm sewer; you'd likely want to contact the local government and/or water company to ask.</p>  <p>Anytime you're digging, you'll want to be aware of where underground utilities are.  In the DC area, you call '<a href="http://www.missutility.net/" rel="nofollow">Miss Utility</a>', and they'll mark out everything.  (I think technically, you're not required if you're digging by hand, but it's still a good idea).</p>  <p>You might also want to take a look at what large trees are nearby, as you might have to deal with roots -- you can cut them as you go, but that might end up killing the tree or weakening it so it sheds branches, and large branches falling on your house or car is not a good thing.  (especially when you have no power, so get trapped in your (damaged) home).</p>  <p>You'll want to look at what's down-slope of the area you're dealing with, and how much area you have to absorb the water once you move it down there, if you're going the french drain route.  If it's an area that already gets pretty marshy after a rain, it's not going to absorb anything, so you'll need to go far enough out 'til you find somewhere that'll take the water.  You also don't want to try to force it out near the property line, or you might piss off your neighbors (and if they're lawyers, or just happen to like suing, it could get messy).</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>And after all of that, you might want to look into if the area's abnormally wet -- one of my friends had problems for years, and dug up his yard multiple times, trying to get everything fixed, redid his basement at least twice because of water damage.  And it turned out that there was a broken water pipe next to his house that was saturating the lawn, so any significant rain couldn't be absorbed.</p>
616		<p>"Will this improve the value of my home?": probably not from a purely resale value.  Whereas updating your kitchen almost always has a great return on your investment, I am not so sure an electric fireplace in your living room would give you the same return.  Some future buyers would see it as a benefit and others would not like it (kind of like the return you get on installing a swimming pool - it helps as much as it hurts).  And also it depends on what it would do to the overall interior design/look and feel of the space in general.  </p>  <p>But keep in mind this is something your wife really wants to do so maybe it goes beyond the return on investment and then there are non-monetary benefits associated with its purchase and installation.</p>
617		<p>You can start off with taking a 50/50 solution of bleach and water, then spraying the mold with it. Wait a few days. </p>  <p>To prevent it in the future, when showering you should be using the bathroom fan to allow the hot air to be exhausted outside rather than condense on the walls and ceiling (which are made of drywall of course). </p>  <p>They also make mold-inhibiting paint and mold-inhibiting drywall. Depending on your bathroom and funds, this may be a long term option. But bleach/water mixture will be your first step.</p>
618		<p>Wash it off with some bleach and warm water.  And then make sure you ventilate your bathroom well after taking a shower (or whenever the humidity levels in the bathroom increase).</p>
619		<p>Most home renovations usually don't get a full return on investment. Kitchens and bathrooms usually return the most value at resale. This <a href="http://www.sixwise.com/newsletters/06/01/04/which-home-renovations-are-your-best-investments.htm" rel="nofollow">article</a> gives a good breakdown of common renos. As Eric says, what's it worth to your family? That's usually the driving force behind a renovation, and ROI is a pleasant side effect. (Unless you're trying to flip a house.)</p>
620		<p>First find out whether it is mold or not. What you do next depends on this.</p>  <p>Assuming it is mold you need to do two things.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Clean it off - disinfectant/bleach solution should do the job.</p></li> <li><p>Find out why it's forming. This is the important bit as if you just do the first step it will come back.</p></li> </ol>  <p>The usual cause is condensation which in a bathroom means you have insufficient ventilation.</p>  <p>So the ultimate cure is to fit an extractor fan above the bath to remove the steam. You can get ones that wire up to the light circuit and then "run on" after the light is switched off to provide additional ventilation.</p>  <p>Once you've done this redecorate.</p>
621		<p>Yup, probably mold.  First you'll want to clean it up.  A weak solution of water and bleach should do the trick.  </p>  <p>To make sure it stays gone, you'll want to make sure your bathroom is properly ventilated.  If you don't have a vent fan, you'll want to install one.  If you already have one, you'll want to make sure you use it.  Hooking it up so it automatically turns on with the light is a good way of doing that.</p>  <p>They also have a mold-preventative that you can add to paint (pretty sure home depot carries it).  I would strongly recommend using that and repainting the ceiling.  I've used it myself several times and it works very well.</p>
622	Will running a dehumidifier near new concrete cause it to cure poorly?	<p>I have a new house with high humidity in the basement.  Will running a dehumidifier constantly cause the new concrete to cure poorly?</p>
623		<p>How new is this house? The concrete should cure within a few days. In fact, you probably wouldn't live in the house if the foundation wasn't cured properly. </p>
624		<p>I seems to me that waxing the outside of the AC unit is only going to protect cosmetic appeal. If you're interested in keeping the unit looking nice from the outside, then  it could help. Otherwise, I wouldn't put in the effort.</p>
625	How wide should I make my game-room if I want to fit a "full-size" pool table in it?	<p>I'm starting to look at finishing my basement, and am playing with a couple different layouts. I definitely want to put a pool table down there - and later sell the house with this being one of the big selling points.  Length shouldn't be an issue, but how wide does my room need to be to properly fit a full-size pool table and comfortably play on it?</p>
626		<p>I've got one in my bedroom, and I still don't regret buying it. It is kind of nice in the winter and the modern ones simulate the look of a real fire pretty well. </p>  <p>Ultimately, it is just a fancy space-heater though. I really doubt it will affect your property values one way or the other unless you do some kind of permanent installation. Mine just sits along a wall and is plugged in. No major install needed (although there was some assembly required). </p>  <p>In most cases, I've heard that there are almost no renovations you can do that yield a positive ROI especially if you don't plan to sell the home fairly quickly after the renovation. The exception to this rule is where you are fixing something. For example, cracks in the fascia or carpet from the stone age. </p>
627	Is a gas water heater safe in a bedroom?	<p>My existing water heater is electric and is likely to need replacing soon. The heater is in a converted garage that I use as a guest room. </p>  <p>As the house is piped for gas, I'm considering the purchase of a gas water heater to replace the electric one. Is there any hazard with a modern gas water heater being used near where people are sleeping? (I'm more concerned here with fumes than the possibility of explosion.)</p>
628		<p>Nope, I wouldn't worry about it.  The concrete should be more or less at full strength within 30 days of being laid, but it'll continue to cure over about a year or so.</p>
629		<p>You need enough room to be able to properly line up and execute any shot. I would say you need at least 5 to 6ft "elbow room" around the table.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>A regulation sized pool table is 4.5'x9'.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_dimensions_of_a_pool_table" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p>  <p>So your room needs to be 14.5' x 19' to 16.5' x 21' (which sounds very large).</p>
631		<p>At a minimum, you'll want 5 feet in every direction around the table to have enough room to use a full size stick.  They do of course make short sticks for tight areas though.  Not ideal, but it's an option if you don't have 15' or so to work with.</p>
632		<p>Here is another <a href="http://www.billiards.com/article/pool-table-room-size" rel="nofollow">good source</a> for sizing a room for various sized pool tables.</p>  <p>This table (borrowed from that site) is a good rule of thumb when using full sized cue sticks.</p>  <pre> Table Size        Minimum Room Size  Playing surface   3.5' x 7'         16' 8" x 13' 6"    39.5" x 79"   4' x 8'           17' 4" x 13' 11"   44" x 88"   4.25' x 8.5'      17' 9" x 14' 1"    46" x 92"   4.5' x 9'         18' 4" x 14' 6"    50" x 100"    </pre>
633		<p>In my opinion one of the critical flaws of most home automation systems is that they break the user interface which we've all grown up with. The person who puts the system in has, implicitly, chosen to break the UI but others have not made this choice: thus the stress. </p>  <p>The best way to avoid this is to not break the user interface. Take lights, for example. The most common UI for lights is a switch on the wall. We're comfortable with that being abstracted to two+ switches in halls and rooms with multiple doors. For automation to be used yet the UI not be broken the automation must use a switch + electronic control. An example of this is a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006I34OK" rel="nofollow">wall switch like this X10 one</a>.  <img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517OabEhvUL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>The "wall wart" automation controls which fit between a lamp or appliance and the wall socket almost always break the expectations of users. These guys should be avoided: <img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/218DG8AM2EL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>An exception is any use where there is not a natural switch, such as Christmas lights, a pump, humidifier, etc. </p>  <p>For home theater I've had pretty good luck with universal remotes, but, in my experience, it takes a fairly expensive ($150+) to get a UI that is simple enough yet full featured enough. The <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00119T6NQ" rel="nofollow">Logitech Harmony remotes</a> do a pretty good job at this:</p>  <p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UBOnmitOL._AA300_.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>The bottom line seems to be "make user interface a priority and a key feature" when doing anything DIY, and especially home automation. And something that is a priority is something worth spending time and money on to get it right. </p>
634		<p>Pretty sure codes prevent using a gas appliance in a location where it will get it's combustion air from a bedroom.  The reason for this is that if the heater is burning up all the oxygen in the room and it can't be replaced quickly enough through natural air flow through the house, you'd end up being asphyxiated in your sleep.</p>  <p>I think there's an exception though if you use a direct-vent model that gets it's combustion air from the outside.  So you would need to make sure whatever hot water heater you buy is rated for that kind of installation.</p>
635		<p>Just putting thermostatic valves on each radiator is the standard solution these days.  </p>  <p>However having zones will you set each zone to come on at a different time as well as giving them their own thermostat.  You can do anything with a combination boiler that you can do with a system boiler of the same rating.</p>  <p>You may not even need to add a 2nd pump if you design the system carefully.</p>  <hr>  <p>Remember last winter was very cold by UK standards, so it is not a good indication of ongoing gas usage.</p>
636	Is there a cheap way to test for mold spores?	<p>We had toxic mold during the wintertime, which has been removed, by replacing the affected Sheetrock. However, my wife has often still the same symptoms she had at the time. Getting a contractor with the proper equipment out is very expensive. Are there any other cheap "household" tricks to be able to make at least a non-scientific test?</p>
637		<p><strong>Duct board systems should not be cleaned</strong>. They will rip and send more junk into your air. However a metal duct system can be cleaned. </p>  <p>If you use a good filter you should never need to. </p>
638		<p>Not only it will not cause damage, but also it helps the concrete to be more solid in less time: I used the same technique adjusting a very wet basement. The results were stunning (also the amount of water drained that I had to drop was so!).</p>
639		<p>Amazon carries <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000BQY8B0" rel="nofollow">home mold tests</a>. I have no idea if these are any good, but they are pretty inexpensive:</p>  <p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Jed%2Bu%2BTBL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
640	How often should the air filter in the furnace be changed?	<p>Does the period of change of this air filter have an affect on the longevity of the heating and a/c system? What is a good rule of thumb to require replacement?</p>
641		<p><strong>This will decrease your capacity and efficiency</strong></p>  <p>As stated <a href="http://www.ccacac.com/maintenance-tips/tips/maintenance-homeowners-can-do/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccacac.com/maintenance-tips/tips/maintenance-homeowners-can-do/</a> it talks about just weeds, and dirt much less a thick coat of wax.</p>  <ol> <li><p>Keep your outside unit clean and free of debris and plants.  Grass clippings and vines can clog the outside coil and restrict the airflow.  This will decrease your capacity and efficiency.  Make sure that bushes and shrubs do not grow too close to the unit and restrict the airflow.  The air must be able to escape freely from the discharge of the unit.  Any restriction in this area can cause the hot air to be recirculated back through the unit.  This will make the unit work much harder and reduce the efficiency and capacity.</p></li> <li><p>Rinse the coil on the outside unit.  This will clean the loose dirt, salt, and sand from the coil.  Do not wash it with pressure, simply rinse it from the top down to let the dirt freely flow out.  Washing it with pressure may pack the dirt into the center of the coil.  Pressure should only be used from the inside out to push the dirt out the way it came in.  Rinsing the coil should be done about once a month during the cooling season.</p></li> </ol>
642		<p>The amount of oxygen consumed by a hot water heater is negligible. The risk of the gas heater sucking all the oxygen out of the room is zero. Now that does not mean that it's code to have it in a bedroom, but there is no safety issue from consumption of oxygen. </p>  <p>The safety issue is on venting of the carbon monoxide (CO) from the hot water heater. In order to make the install safe, ensure that the new gas water heater is properly vented through the ceiling. There are lots of resources online about properly venting gas appliances. Here's a <a href="http://www.askthebuilder.com/205_Water_Heater_Venting.shtml" rel="nofollow">reasonable one to start with</a>. </p>  <p>Obviously since a gas hot water heater requires adding a vent, it's more expensive to install. You may find that an electric water heater still makes financial sense once you consider installation costs. </p>  <p>As noted in the comments, be sure and get a CO detector for the room. These are relatively inexpensive and you can get them at your local hardware store or <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000FDLFLK" rel="nofollow">order through Amazon</a>. </p>
643		<p>It depends on the filter.  Go to Lowes or Home Depot and they will have a chart with the different filter qualities and the recommended length of time they can be in service.  In general, the cheapest filters that cost only a couple of bucks have to be replaced once a month.  As you go up to more expensive filters, you can replace them every 3 or 6 months.</p>  <p>I currently buy the ones that need to be replaced every 3 months.</p>
644		<p>Dirty filters not only make the HVAC equipment not last as long, but the low air flow makes them less energy efficient. A dirty furnace does not conduct heat into the air as well and the dirt sticks to the fan blades making it not last as long or spin as easily. </p>  <p>There are two main types of air filters: </p>  <p>The 1" thick ones that look like this: <img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21cq0e5qW7L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="alt text"> </p>  <p>And the 6" thick filters look like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.filterscanada.ca/carrier_makpak_media_pleated_furnace_filter.gif" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>Generally the 1" filters are good for a month or two. The 6" thick ones are good for 6 months. </p>  <p>There are also 2", 4", and 5" filters available but generally not at the local hardware store. Some folks who have 6" filters use a 2" + 4" filter and replace the 2" one every other month and the 4" once a year. This seems like a hassle to me, but it might save you $50 a year if you have 6" filters.</p>
645		<p>The rule of thumb is every 3 months but it does depend on the filter and your air quality. And yes, if you don't keep the filter clean it will shorten the life of your unit and could cause other problems like a frozen coil (where the air handler coil freezes because there isn't enough airflow).</p>  <p>I like to use the cheap air filters as they allow the best airflow. Some units are made for the better filters but those can cause more problems than the solve.</p>
646		<p>I've got two ideas. </p>  <p>The first is to use a <a href="http://www.directindustry.com/prod/isoloc/chemical-wall-plug-27405-212746.html" rel="nofollow">chemical wall plug</a>, but the second has a requirement.</p>  <p>If you can drill through that wall, I suggest to put on the other side of the wall a metal plate (width, height and thickness are up to you that know how many Kilograms the shelf it supposed to get on itself), then make three holes in the shape of a triangle (with the single vertice facing the floor and the other two facing the roof) and use one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aScrew_thread_Z%C3%A1vit_M16.jpg" rel="nofollow">screw thread</a> for each hole.</p>
647		<p>Never leave wire ends unprotected, even for a moment. It's too easy to get distracted and forget to replace a wire cap or crimp a connector. And once the junction box (or wall!) is closed up, it's too late, and some day later you cause an electrical fire.</p>
648		<p>1) The issues around curing concrete too quickly are where the concrete is thin and in direct sunlight (i.e. a sidewalk in the sun). The concrete in your basement has cured enough to be structurally sound. The rule of thumb I have heard is that concrete cures 85% in the first 7 days. 10% over the next 3 weeks and the remaining 5% over the next 20 years. </p>  <p>2) Even if the concrete had just been poured, you would not be able to make it dry too quickly with a home dehumidifier. Home humidifiers can only draw 30-100 pints (3.75 - 12.5) gallons a day and that would require you had it plumbed into a drain so you never had to stop it to empty it. Plus the moisture from the concrete just can't transfer to the air that quickly.</p>  <p>If you have moisture in your basement that is resulting in high humidity the risk of mold should be your concern. Run a dehumidifier and measure moisture in each basement room. Move the dehumidifier around as needed. </p>
649		<p>I know you've checked the door but here is how you know if the door is okay . . . disconnect the garage door opener and open the garage door half way.  If it stays there then the garage door is balanced, otherwise there are problems.</p>  <p>Sure, the motor could be burned out but if the door isn't balanced the replacement unit will burn out too!</p>  <p>If the unit is old I would replace it. Lots of times it's not just the motor but the gears inside too. </p>
650	Using a char coal BBQ, how far should I be away from the house?	<p>Are there any guidelines, rules anywhere?</p>
652	How can I have a pond but prevent mosquitos to nest there?	<p>I would like to have a small waterfall leading into a small pond in my garden. Due to the Westnile virus, it is essential here to prevent mosquitoes to nest. What can I do to prevent mosquitoes to be able to nest in it?</p>
653		<p>A couple options:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Make it small enough that the waterfall will keep the water moving.  Mosquitoes like standing water, but not moving water.</p></li> <li><p>Add some fish.  Fish love to eat Mosquito larvae.</p></li> </ol>
654		<p>It really depends on the material of your house and the height of the overhang. </p>  <p>In one extreme, if you have a brick house with no overhang you can be almost right up against it. </p>  <p>Vinyl siding and/or 9' overhang is the other extreme. You should probably not be within 10' of vinyl siding. </p>  <p>Somewhere in the middle is wood siding which probably will not burn but you might get paint bubbling if you are within 3'</p>  <p>As a general rule you don't want to be under a 1 story overhang which will hold heat and any sparks in. </p>
655		<p>In addition to introducing predators like fish and dragonflies and moving water, many folks use Rabon blocks which are fed to livestock to prevent flies and mosquitoes from breeding in the animal waste. Rabon (tetrachlorvinphos) blocks are nontoxic to animals but cause the larva to not develop and thus interrupts the life cycle of mosquitoes and flies. You can break the Rabon up and sprinkle it in the water to help prevent mosquitoes from breeding. </p>  <p>Rabon can be purchased at farm supply stores or <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000I1O8JA">via Amazon</a>.</p>

658	Good low cost tools for woodwork	<p>I'm starting to get into some woodwork for building a desk for my home and I need to purchase some tools, but I'm not really sure of what to look for to determine if a tool is of good quality.</p>  <p>I don't want superb top of the line tools as I won't be using them that often but I need something that will not hinder my work, and I definitely want something that will at least be good for a couple years (maybe).</p>  <p>I'll probably be needing </p>  <ul> <li>a power drill</li> <li>a circular saw</li> <li>a jig saw</li> <li>orbital sander or belt sander</li> </ul>
659		<p>My absolute favorite power drill I've bought is a <a href="http://www.ryobitools.com/catalog/12v_lithium#/overview" rel="nofollow">Ryobi 12V cordless</a>. They don't make the same model I have now, but the current "One+" series takes both the old 12V batteries that I have, and the newer lithium batteries (my brother has one of those - it can charge a battery in about 45 minutes!)</p>  <p>One of the nice things about the drill, other than the fact that it was under $60, is the magnetic tray on the bottom - it's wonderful for holding bits as you change them in and out. I use my drill as a power screwdriver all the time, so having the tray to hold screws and the bit I use to pre-drill the hole is nice.</p>  <p>The great thing about the cordless series is that you can get a bunch of different tools that all use the same batteries.

662		<p><a href="http://www.simplepestcontrol.com/ant-control.htm">Ant Control on Simple Pest Control</a> has a huge list of ant control techniques (even mentioning your boiling water idea, which I'd never heard of - I'll have to try that!). It includes a lot about behavior control, ie, keep them from wanting in your house to begin with, to keeping them out of the areas you don't want them in, etc.</p>  <p>The <em><a href="http://www.simplepestcontrol.com/ant-control.htm#biological">Biological Control</a></em> section lists several natural ways of getting rid of ants:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Make your own boric acid bait to kill ant colonies.</strong> Ant baits are the cornerstone of all ant control. Instead of spraying poisons everywhere, which can split colonies up and potentially make ant control more difficult, you bring the ant to the poison. The worker/foraging ants then take the poison back to the nest to share with larvae and queen. This is how colonies die, or are reduced to acceptable levels. Boric acid is a perfect ant poison. Itâs cheap, natural, and much less dangerous (though not harmless) than commercial poisons. Best of all, when mixed correctly, boric acid is a slow ant killer â it allows ants time to bring it back to the nest in sufficient quantities for an ant apocalypse. Here are a few boric acid ant bait recipes:</p>      <ul>   <li><p>Mix three cups of water with one cup sugar and four teaspoons of boric acid (Borax). Pour around a cup of solution into separate jars. Pack the jars with cotton balls to about the halfway point. Seal the lid and poke a few holes at the center. Make a fun skull-and crossbones label and set the jars out in ant trails and hotspots.</p></li>   <li><p>Some ants prefer protein and grease over sugar (little black ants, thief ants, pavement ants, big headed antsâ¦). Replace the sugar in the above recipe with canned pet food. Or try this recipe: Mix four tablespoons of peanut butter with six tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon Borax.</p></li>   </ul>      <p><strong>Use diatomaceous earth</strong> â the slow ant killer. Most ant species are susceptible to diatomaceous earth, a desiccant dust consisting of the fossilized shells of ancient algae. These shells are covered in microscopic shards which create cuts in the cuticle of crawling insects. The ants walk over the DE, start leaking, dehydrate, and die. You can apply DE as an ant barrier around the outside of your home or inside, around the perimeter of rooms and carpets (be sure itâs food grade). You can mix DE in water to make a paste to apply to trees. You can get proactive and dust nearby anthills. Using a duster, you can apply DE to the cracks, crevices, and wall voids, where it will remain effective forever.</p>      <p><strong>Capsaicin</strong> â a natural ant repellent. Chili pepper, black pepper, red pepper, ginger, and paprika all contain capsaicin and so can be used to repel ants. Iâve heard of people using it as a barrier around homes, but it is best used in gardens. You can apply these powders around the base of plants or in wide bands (5-6 inches) between rows.</p>      <p><strong>Citrus oils</strong> kill ants. Linalool and d-limonene - citrus peel extracts found in products like Orange Guard, Citra-Solve, BugsâRâDone and Pro-Citra DL Aerosol â can be used for ant control in a variety of ways. They can be used as a direct kill spray, a repellent in gardens, as a drench for anthills and outdoor nests, or for treatment of cracks and crevices where ants are nesting indoors (may stain).</p> </blockquote>

666		<p>As others have pointed out, resale value of any particular feature depends on who you are selling to. In my mind seeing an electric fireplace would trigger the following thoughts: "Looks temporary and cheap. What other things did they skimp on? How much would it cost me to deal with these things down the road?". But obviously not everybody is like me -- other people might be thrilled to see this thing -- study your target demographic. </p>  <p>Another important aspect is that making one's wife happy for
667		<p>A good <a href="http://woodworking.about.com/od/toolsequipment/p/chisels.htm" rel="nofollow">chisel</a> is in any woodworker's toolbox. </p>
668		<p>1-2 months for a 1" filter, and 6 months for a 6" filter is a good rule of thumb. However, that is for average conditions in an average home. You may want to check yours more frequently if you have any pets since fur will tend to dirty up the filter quicker, and reducing the filter's usable life.</p>  <p>You can also compare a new one (or photo of a new one that you took before putting it in) with the current one to determine how "bad" or "dirty" the current one looks. If it looks bad, change it.</p>
669	Why does my kitchen faucet cut out intermittently?	<p>Sometimes when I'm running water from my kitchen faucet, it will cut out for no apparent reason.  It doesn't seem to matter if I'm running hot or cold water (or a mixture), but does seem to happen more often if I'm running the faucet fully open.</p>  <p>I can usually fix it by closing and opening the faucet a couple of times.  If that doesn't work, pulling the trigger on the -- separate -- pull-out spray nozzle often does it, and if <em>that</em> doesn't work, just turning it off and leaving it for a while will do it.</p>  <p>What is causing this behavior and what can I do to prevent it from occurring in the future?</p>
670	Is it normal to miter the non-pivoting edge of a door?	<p>Recently I've seen someone miter the edge of a bathroom and closet door so it swings shut without hitting the door frame. I've never seen this before -- is it normal?</p>  <p>Clarification: The edge that was mitered was the part that would swing into the door frame first due to the angle the door is at while closing it.</p>
671		<p>I may be way off base here but have you tried removing the aerator on the faucet and letting it run on both hot and cold fully open (separately)? It's possible that the aerator could be clogging up and causing pressure buildup.</p>  <p>If you do not have copper pipes then it's possible that the buildup would be caused by rusting or oxidization in the pipes. Full pressure should knock it loose I think.</p>
672		<p>It shouldn't be necessary.  Some times it might be useful:</p>  <ol> <li>Your hinge plates aren't flush to the surface of the door or the frame.</li> <li>You have a build-up of paint on the door or frame causing the door to rub or stick.</li> <li>Some wood splinters easily if it's cut at a right-angle. Rounding the corners a little can help this.</li> </ol>
673		<p>A <a href="http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=11294" rel="nofollow">Doweling jig</a> can be useful.</p>  <p>or a <a href="http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=5985" rel="nofollow">Pocket hole jig</a>.</p>  <p>And plenty of clamps (big ones, small ones, band clamps are nice).</p>  <p>For power tools I find that <a href="http://www.ryobitools.com/" rel="nofollow">Ryobi</a> has decent tools for a good prices.</p>
674		<p>Improper drainage can cause water to either enter directly into the house (between the slab and cinder block), or build up under the slab. </p>  <p>The water can also be entering the cavity of the cinder block through a small crack, bringing soil and other debris along with it.  When the water evaporates it is possible that it is carrying the odor with it, either up through the cinder block and into the house, or through another crack in the interior of the house.  In a case like this you will most likely not see any signs of water in the house, but it could very well be whats causing the smell.</p>  <p>Make sure the land around the house is properly graded away from the house, and possibly install a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_drain" rel="nofollow">French drain</a> especially if the land is graded towards the house.  The drain can be used to divert water safely away from the house, and can usually be installed by a DoItYourselfer.</p>
675		<p>I have seen outside units whose paint has faded and become chalky-looking after several years of service.  I suppose waxing it might prevent or delay this, but I agree with Doresoom that the benefit is really going to be mainly cosmetic.</p>
676	Gutter Installation	<p>Should gutters be placed above the garage door? I have a roof that peaks like a mountain (hip?). Most houses I see have gutters around the house but the roof above garage is largely ignored. I will be installing gutters soon on my house (it has none) and I am curious on what others have done.</p>  <p>Roof</p>  <h2>^^^</h2>  <p>-+-+-+</p>  <p>Garage</p>
677		<p>Gutters are for water management. If you have a paved drive and it drains well then you don't need gutters in front of the door. If water tends to flow back toward the garage when it runs off the roof then you should put a gutter in. Having a gutter will mean less splash on the bottom of your garage door which may help the door last longer. </p>  <p>What others do with their gutters is fairly irrelevant to your situation. </p>
678	Plugging a hole in the ceiling	<p>We had an electrician install a light in our ceiling.  In the process he had to move the fitting about 10 centimeters which left a hole roughly three centimeters in diameter.</p>  <p>He tried to pug it using filler which is a disaster.</p>  <p>What's the best way for a hack like myself to plug this hole?</p>
679		<p>For a 3cm hole, a lightweight compound should do the job. Patch it and paint it.</p>
680		<p>Remove the metal brace if necessary and insert a small wood panel such that is overlaps enough on both sides. Then you can nail a small piece of Sheetrock in the size of the whole onto this wood panel that it is flush with the ceiling. Finally you can paint this in the same colour as the rest of the ceiling.</p>
681	How can I seal the grout on kitchen wall tiles to give lasting stain and mold protection?	<p>I have 1.5mm of white grout between rectified white tiles on my kitchen walls as a splashback (or <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=splashback%2C+backsplash&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all">backsplash in North America</a>*) behind the sink and cooktop and I'm concerned about stains from food and mould.</p>  <p>I've read on the web I'm supposed to seal the grout using a soak-in sealant in what sounds like a very time-consuming prcoess that has to be repeated <em>every year, forever</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Is there a more long-lasting way to do this?</strong></p>  <p>Surely just using that new "no-mould-for-five-years" white silicone sealant would be better than that?</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>.</p>  <p>((* this is hilarious - I'm imagining some dopey kitchen contractor who says it wrong migrating from the US to Australia or vice versa and everyone picking up the wrong term))</p>
682		<p><strong>Quick clamps.</strong></p>  <p><img src="http://www.diyskate.com/img/ramps/tools/quick_clamp.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>about a million times better than these:</p>  <p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7UH1P0Umjhk/STd1vl8KrSI/AAAAAAAABU0/o9ktdq8o7g8/s320/clamps.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
683		<p>I fear there'll be no easy answer. Are your baseboards/skirting boards fixed to the wall above the flooring? If so you may be able to remove them and fix them slightly higher so the flooring can slide underneath. </p>
684		<p>Wheelchair access needn't be completely 100% level, it just can't have steps. </p>  <p>It's feasible to use a door sill (such as <a href="http://www.marchesironmongery.co.uk/exitex-threshex-sill-1220mm-aluminium.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>) to stop weather getting in under a door. It's also possible to have a narrow channel under the door, too, that takes rain and moisture off to the side. </p>
685	How do I add a quiet blower or fan to a gas fireplace?	<p>I have beautiful fireplace in my family room, although it is gas rather than wood burning, and it vents strait outside. Due to the nature of how it is vented, I don't really get much heat from it, and I think I am losing a lot of the heat it could be generating during winter (and therefor wasting a lot of energy and increasing my cost.)</p>  <p>After reading my fireplace manual, it appears that I can install a blower that can move heated air from around the exhaust back into the room. There were no instructions on how to do so, however.</p>  <p>What would it take to install a blower into my fireplace, and where might I find a very quiet blower? The noise level is an important factor, as I've heard some fireplace blowers that are extremely noisy, and given the acoustics of the room, I worry it will drown out sound from the entertainment system.</p>
686	How do I cover old baseboard (skirting)?	<p>I have some old skirting (I believe baseboard is the familiar term for most of you: the wood covering the join between my floor and walls).</p>  <p>The floor tiler failed to tell us that it could easily be removed before tiling and re-done afterwards (and <em>should</em> be if you want it to look good, which is obviously the point of getting new tiles). So now I have a very expensive and nice tile floor that looks a bit cheap and shoddy because the edges are a bit messy and the skirting is old (and uneven in places), and I can't remove it because the tile is holding it in.</p>  <p>How can I cover it up?</p>  <p>I'm imagining there is a product out there somewhere which is sort of a trim for concealing smaller old trim like mine. Looks just like largish trim but is "hollow" underneath, like in this ascii-art diagram:</p>  <pre> WALL : : : :-------IMAGINARY CONCEALING TRIM :\____ | :__  | | : |  | | :.|..|_|.........FLOOR   ^  |  OLD SKIRTING </pre>  <p>Does anything like this exist?</p>  <p>Or any better solutions?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong><br> Quarter round has been mentioned, and that hides the bottom of the trim (skirting/baseboard), but I also need to hide the <em>top</em> (it's very uneven and clearly lower than in adjoining rooms).</p>
687		<p>Home improvement stores have grout sealers. I have used them in the kitchen and on the bathroom floors. Works well in both places. It is very easy to use. Just make sure the grout has set up and is dry.</p>
688		<p>If you do this, make sure you don't get any wax on the coil!  Doing so would hurt the unit's performance. </p>  <p>As others have said, this is totally a cosmetic thing. It won't help the life of the unit much. When the unit needs to be replaced, it will be because the coil or compressor is busted (probably 15yrs from now), and you've decided it isn't worth repairing. It's not going to need replacement because the frame has some surface rust. </p>
689		<p>I had a similar issue when the electrician installing my fan had to install the fan box properly on a stud because the previous box was not on a stud. A hole about as large as yours was left. What you can do is take those <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_49431-1168-5504_0_?productId=3034269&amp;Ntt=wall+patch&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=/pl__0__s?newSearch=true%24Ntt=wall%20patch%24y=0%24x=0" rel="nofollow">wall patches that you purchase at Lowes</a> or Home Depot and place it over the hole with some spackle to make it stick at first. After you have spackled and attached the patch, then spackle all over the patch to smooth it out. Let it dry, then sand, primer, and paint.</p>
690		<p>The Trane unit has a special coat of paint that will make it look good for years and years, I doubt you will need to wax it.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qAx3x.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qAx3xl.png" alt="enter image descriptionhere"></a></p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://www.trane.com/Residential/Downloads/Brochure/T%20XR%20Brochure%20Air%20Conditioners%2072-1210-07%20RO.pdf" rel="nofollow">See Page 5 of the Trane informational packet:</a>.</p>
691		<p>I think this is a problem easily solved by <a href="http://www.hardwoodinstaller.com/hardwoodinstaller/thresholds-quarter-round-installation.htm" rel="nofollow">Quarter round</a>. Actually I think this is why quarter round was invented.</p>  <p>If the existing molding is small enough you could possibly cover it up, but it might look even worse if the original molding is too large because the cover would have to be bigger.</p>  <p>If you want to cover the original molding you could get larger molding, and using a router hollow out part of it so the old molding fits inside.  Then simply nail it on.</p>  <p>Other than that you could always ask the tiler if he could fix the problem (at his own cost of course), because it sounds like he did not do a proper job.  If you have not paid him, consider withholding the payment until the job is done properly.</p>
692		<p>I would contact the manufacturer of the fireplace; either by phone or on the web, they should have a blower designed for your fireplace.  They may also provide instructions on hooking it up, or offer installation as a service. </p>
693		<p><a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/392/how-do-i-fix-a-squeaky-floor-below-my-carpet/393#393">An answer to a question about squeaky floors</a> recommended <a href="http://www.123itsdone.com/" rel="nofollow">Squeeeeek No More screws</a>. You screw them in until a certain depth and then break the head off, so the top wood is fixed to the bottom wood (it probably won't work with a concrete floor, like we usually have here in Europe), without a visible screw head (you fill the small hole with wood filler). I don't know whether it works with laminate flooring, and whether you can get it in New Zealand, but you can always ask them.</p>  <p>This will of course remove the freedom of the movement of the wood, I don't know whether that is a good idea or not.</p>
694		<p>Water is a very damaging force, over time it could cause a rut or divots in the driveway.  Putting up a gutter will prevent this, for the cost of the gutter it is worth it.</p>  <p>If the roof slopes down to the garage door put a gutter, if not you don't need one.  The only reason you would need one is if the rain water is draining off the roof onto the driveway in front of the garage door.</p>
695		<p>I'm surprised no one has mentioned them but I think a good set of chisels are invaluable. Any time you're working with wood, a sharp set of chisels can be the key to getting a good fit and finish. </p>  <p><img src="http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/bb/bbd57c9f-731a-4157-a906-88f6437204b9_400.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
696		<p>I'm assuming you're talking about the condensing unit sitting outside? </p>  <p>I'd say you'll wear out the unit long before the frame becomes damaged enough to affect it's function. </p>
697		<p>A decent quarter-sheet, general purpose palm sander. Especially one with decent fastening capabilities.</p>  <p><img src="http://www.plumbersurplus.com/images/prod/5/Bosch-1297DK-rw-80730-148351.jpg" alt="Bosch 1297"></p>
699	What do you do/ask when hiring a contractor	<p>In a world where every guy with a truck full of tools is a "contractor", how do you weed out the good from the bad?</p>
700		<p>I typically ask around at work for referrals - we have a junk mail board that's a great place for posts like that.  You could also look at the Better Business Bureau for your area, or look at a site like <a href="http://www.angieslist.com/angieslist/" rel="nofollow">Angie's List</a>. You could also ask the contractor for references.</p>
701		<p>Ask to see some of their work and talk to previous clients. The good ones will put you in touch with previous clients straight away. The bad ones will prevaricate.</p>  <p>Don't employ the ones that come round touting for business. If they have the time to drive around looking for "damaged" roofs, driveways in need of repair etc. then they can't be that good. Having a full schedule is usually a good sign.</p>
702		<p><strong>Talk to at least 2.</strong> </p>  <p>Every contractor does things differently. Each will bring up concerns and ideas that others do not. You will learn a lot from these conversations that will help you make a good decision.</p>
703		<p>You only need to do this if you've incorrectly mounted the hinge. The better solution would be to remount the hinges so you don't have to do this. </p>
704	What are the recommended settings for a dual-zone air conditioning unit?	<p>What are the recommended settings for an air conditioning unit that is dual-zone? Meaning, if I have a house that is two stories I know that in Florida they recommend you keep it at 78 F in the summer and 69 in the winter, but the top half of the house will always get hotter (and colder in the winter). So what are the recommended settings for a house in a configuration like this that achieve the best of comfort and energy savings?</p>
705		<p>It looks like you're using untreated dimensional lumber for your deck. If you want that to last you really need to paint it. That would get rid of the stamps. Untreated fir like that really doesn't like to be outdoors. Even with a deck sealer you're not going to get the life out of it that you'll be happy with I think. Especially if it's uncovered as most decks are. </p>
706		<p>Grout sealer would be the obvious way to do it, but another way would be to have the tile reglazed.  </p>  <p>As a side effect of reglazing the tile, the grout is glazed over as well, making it much easier to clean.  It would be more expensive of course to have that done, but it would give you the option to change the color of the tile as well if you wanted to.</p>
707		<p>A few ideas:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Ask for references.  This can work nice, but since the contractor can choose which references to give you, doesn't always give an accurate picture.</p></li> <li><p>If they are in a regulated trade (electrician, plumber, builder, etc.) ask your local city code inspector.  They know all the contractors and know which ones do good work and which ones do just enough to pass inspection.</p></li> <li><p>Check with your local building/plumbing/electrical supply stores.  They know the contractors and which ones are good or bad.</p></li> </ol>
708		<p>There are a number of good ideas already given, I would add to check their license.  I know Florida keeps a nice online presence <a href="http://www.myflorida.com/licensee/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myflorida.com/licensee/</a></p>
709	How do I seal seams between bricks on a patio without using sand?	<p>I have a patio that's made of bricks with fine sand filling the gaps. This is turning out to be a maintenance hassle. Every time the kid or dog gets mud or crud on the patio I hose it off and manage to blow more and more sand out of the cracks. </p>  <p>Is there a way to seal the seams between the bricks or use something more sticky than sand... like a fine grout? I like the look just fine, but it appears that I'm going to be spending a lot more time than I desire on maintenance of my patio. </p>
710		<p>What you are looking for is a <a href="http://www.pavetech.com/paveChem/sand.shtml" rel="nofollow">joint sand stabilizing sealer</a>.  That should prevent washout as well as weed growth in the joints.</p>
711		<p>You could mix up a fine sand &amp; cement mixture brush that into the gaps then water the patio to turn that into mortar in place.</p>  <p>You'd need to make sure the patio was clean first, and don't use too much water.</p>  <p>Though this would be a fairly permanent solution.</p>
712		<p>Depending on the layout, you might be able to fix this without taking up any of the flooring.  Here in the US at least, laminate flooring is usually installed in a floating manner, where the individual laminate boards are not attached to the subfloor at all and the entire floor is free to expand and contract (assuming it's not bound up at the edges).  The expansion gap around the perimeter of the room is hidden under a baseboard and some variety of quarter-round or shoe molding.</p>  <p>If your floor is buckling because its expansion gap isn't big enough, you should be able to remove that shoe molding and baseboard and cut the edges to increase the gap without pulling up the flooring.  I'd recommend an oscillating multifunction tool for this as it will let you cut very close to the wall, unlike a circular saw.  <a href="http://www.harborfreight.com/multifunction-power-tool-67256.html" rel="nofollow">Here's a cheap one from Harbor Freight</a>.</p>
713		<p>In the US, check their status with the <a href="http://www.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau</a>.  Also, if you hire contractors frequently, you should probably look into subscribing to <a href="http://www.angieslist.com">Angie's List</a>, which crowdsources customer reviews of contractors and other service providers.</p>
714		<p>This may be necessary to repair an old door and frame where age may have been a factor in reducing clearances.</p>
715		<p>What color is the dust that comes off when you drill? If it's just white, you could be just drilling into the plaster instead of the actual solid material underneath. Try drilling deeper holes and see if you hit a more solid surface.</p>
716		<p>If you're doing a job that creates a lot of dust, it's really worth tarping off the doorways to limit exposure.  After doing a floor sanding project, for the next few months my laser printer smelt like a fireplace every time I printed something.</p>
717		<p>I believe this was pretty standard practice when interior doors were solid wood.  My last house was 100 years old, and every interior door had an angle on the edge the way you describe.  Was the guy you saw doing it an old-timer?</p>  <p>I think the practice has advantages.  It allows you to get a smaller reveal between the door and frame, which might look better.  It also lets you even up the reveal without resorting to shimming the hinges. And when the house shifts and the door starts to rub it's much easier to remove the offending bit since you're planing off a bit of an arris rather than a whole flat edge.</p>
718		<p>patching a hole in the ceiling is the same as patching one in the wall (only your arms usually get more tired from being above your head), see this <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/128/what-is-the-best-method-to-patch-a-large-hole-2-3-inches-in-drywall">question</a></p>

720	re-using wood from a concrete form?	<p>I strive to not waste materials wherever possible, and "use once then discard" methods are particularily irksome. So with this mind, what suggestions do you have for enabling re-use of lumber used for concrete forms?</p>
721		<p>If you use it for a form again no problem . . . otherwise, the remnants of the concrete on the wood will damage your power tools.</p>
722	What can I do to fix the dispenser in the front of my fridge?	<p>My ice maker works (so the fridge is connected to water) but when I try to get water or ice from the door on the fridge nothing happens. Is there a fuse or something that could be blown?  I know there is a switch that turns it off when the door is open but how do I take that apart? There are no visible screws or anything.</p>  <p>I don't want to call someone out as it'll probably cost over $200 just to get someone to come over and that's 20% of the cost of the fridge in the first place!</p>
723	How do I compensate for the sun confusing my garage door opener's sensors?	<p>Only during summer and only when the sun is close to the horizon the light from the sun confuses my garage door opener and in order to close the door I have to hold down the wired button which is a real pain if I'm leaving.</p>  <p>A friend suggested I use toilet paper rolls (or maybe some PVC) to shield the sensor from the sun and direct the beam to the other sensor and that's a good idea but it'll mean I have to change how the sensors are mounted to the track and move them out a bit.  Just moving them back might solve the problem (since they'll be blocked by the walls).</p>  <p>Any other suggestions? Is this a common problem?</p>
724		<p>The number of <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/4306646" rel="nofollow">uses</a> a <a href="http://www.acetoolonline.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=STT-45-600&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=StanleyTools45600MetricEnglishSteelCarpentersSquare&amp;utm_content=StanleyTools45600MetricEnglishSteelCarpentersSquare&amp;utm_campaign=googlebase&amp;site=google_base" rel="nofollow">carpenter's square</a> has are almost as many as the uses for the common screwdriver.</p>  <p>See also: <a href="http://zo-d.com/stuff/how-do-i/how-to-use-the-swanson-speed-square-as-a-framing-square.html" rel="nofollow">http://zo-d.com/stuff/how-do-i/how-to-use-the-swanson-speed-square-as-a-framing-square.html</a></p>
725		<p>I found this graph : <a href="http://www.ccacac.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Humidex-Graph.pdf" rel="nofollow">Temperature Settings</a></p>
726		<p>You probably only have to shield the sensor just enough to put a shadow over it (and not let the sun hit it directly).  I would think a small piece of cardboard taped to the side or top (or both) of the sensor that is getting hit with the sun should do it.  </p>  <p>Another way would be to block the sun from outside of the garage by maybe planting a shrub (test it out by putting your garbage can in line to block the sun when it is low in the sky and see if it works).</p>
728		<p>Find out the payment terms.  If they want all or most up-front, it is generally a bad sign.</p>
729		<p>Get a long and sturdy metal level.  Clamp it to plywood and use it as a straightedge for your circular saw.</p>
730		<p>It is not particularly water conscious, but you could open up another hot water tap or two to move the cold water out of the pipes more quickly.</p>
731		<p>I would save it to re-use as a form, or for bracing, or other one-off uses.</p>
732		<p>Have you checked the manual for your fridge?</p>  <p>At the very least it might have disassembly instructions, maybe fuse locations (if any), and possibly some troubleshooting for the front dispenser.</p>
733		<p>When you push the levers in to dispense water/ice, do you hear the motor running (but nothing comes out)?  If so, then it's probably a supply problem (iced up line, etc).  If not, then it's likely an electrical problem.  Most likely a fuse or a bad relay.</p>  <p>To get into the unit, you would (usually) need to remove the whole plastic panel on the inside of the door.  The screws are usually hidden underneath the seal that runs around the edge of the door.  Your user manual might have some useful information as well.</p>
734		<p>What a pain that must be.  Could you raise or lower the sensors a few inches up or down to make it less inline with the sun?  I agree with Jeff, all you need is just enough to make a shadow.  </p>  <p>Really not much else you can do, other than disable the sensors which would obviously dangerous and not recommended.</p>
735	Are High End Furnace Filters worth the cost?	<p>There are many levels of furnace filters.  I can get cheap ones at walmart of a few bucks.  Then there are ones that cost upwards of $30.  I realize that if you have allergies or low immune systems, these are probably worth it.  Also if you have pets they may help.  But for average folks, with no medical needs, are they worth the cost?</p>
736		<p>@Eric's list is great.  I'd add a few more:</p>  <ol> <li>Ask what they do to keep up with developments in their trade.  Most will give you a blank look but some will be incredibly excited to tell you about the latest issue of FHB or Journal of Light Construction.</li> <li>More of a negative thing, but if anybody "helps" you by telling you how to get around permits, etc., then move on to the next candidate.</li> <li>Look at the condition of their tools and vehicles.  The don't have to be new, obviously, but I've found that respect for tools goes hand-in-hand with good work.</li> </ol>
737	How to get discount prices for replacement parts	<p>I inherited an old fridge a while back that had a broken ice maker. I never had an ice maker before I so started to look into fixing it. I found a parts store and bought a new one for $100 and installed it myself . . . it was surprising easy. </p>  <p>I thought I was king of the DIY world until recently I found out that I could buy a new fan motor for my AC unit for $150 but if a "professional" went to the same supplier he could buy the fan for less than $50. Now I'm starting to think that the $100 ice maker repair from 5 years ago would cost less then $30 if I went to the store in overalls or something.</p>  <p>And don't get me started on the price of a capacitor for an AC unit . . . they'll charge you $200 to install a part that they list on the invoice as $140 and $60 for a service call . . . but it's a freaking capacitor! $10 tops.</p>  <p>How can I get the same price the pros get?</p>
738		<p>The problem with the really cheap filters is that you really should replace them monthly.  The slightly more expensive filters often only need to be replaced every 3 months or so, which in reality doesn't actually make them that much more expensive.  </p>  <p>I usually go with the cheapest 3 month filters, since I know I'm not going to get down there every month to replace the super cheap ones.  Aside from that consideration and the ones you already mentioned, there's no need to spend lots of money on a top of the line filter.  They aren't going to make your furnace last any longer.</p>
739	Caulking for deck frame	<p>To seal the seam between a doubled joist or beam, what type of caulking is best? The Home Depot Decks 123 book recommends Alex Plus (acrylic latex plus silicone) while a guy at Home Depot suggested Mono Ultra Exterior (latex). How about Blueskin?</p>  <p>I initially used Alex Plus, it rained before the caulk cured, the caulk became a shriveled and cracked mess, I scraped it and replaced it with Mono Ultra Exterior.</p>
741		<p>You could swap the emitter and detector units so that the emitter is on the sunlit side.  It doesn't matter if the emitter is being blasted by sunlight; only the detector needs to be protected.  Of course you might just be changing the time of day of your problem  if the other side of the door is sunlit at a different time. :)</p>  <p>Don't forget to swap the wiring at the opener unit as well of course.</p>
742	How do I run wires for a wall-mount flatscreen TV?	<p>Like a lot of you, we have several wall-mounted LCD HDTVs in the house. The TVs have two wires -- power and HDMI -- running down the wall to the power outlet and cable box.</p>  <p>I've historically been too timid to try to run the wiring inside the drywall and too cheap to pay someone to do it... and I'm hoping diy.stackexchange.com can come to the rescue.</p>  <p>What is the <strong>easiest</strong> and <strong>least-destrictive</strong> way to run cables from behind the TV (about 4-6 feet high, depending) to the electrical junction boxes on the floor (usually about 3-4 inches high).</p>  <p>Solutions that are too hard/destructive for me:</p>  <ul> <li>Removing and then patching large swaths of drywall. I would like to keep any drywall holes to a size that can be repaired with a small drywall patch kit.</li> <li>Installing an electrical junction box behind the TV. I'm not an electrician and this scares me. Also, it doesn't help with the HDMI table.</li> </ul>  <p>Is this possible for a novice DIYer, or do I need to call in a professional?</p>
743		<p>Placing a tube around the sensor/emitter might work, but it sounds like that would easily break if kicked or struck by something passing by.</p>  <p>Perhaps a polarized filter for a camera would be taped or somehow fixed to the unit.</p>  <p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QEZXHVQZL._SL500_SS75_.jpg" alt="alt text"> Amazon has <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00009W3U6" rel="nofollow">this one for $11.99</a>.</p>
744	How do I fix gutter nails that are coming out?	<p>Many houses in my neighborhood are about 5 years old and are experiencing similar problems with their gutters.  The nails holding them up are pulling out little by little.  A couple homeowners had their fall off.  I took and look at mine and saw a few nails sticking out.  What's the correct way to fix this?</p>  <ol> <li>Just hammer them back in and hope for the best?</li> <li>Fill hole with adhesive (Liquid Nails?) and hammer back in?</li> <li>Hammer in a different kind of nail?</li> </ol>
745		<p>The really really easy way to do this is to use trunking: this is plastic square conduit, with a lid on the fourth side. Some makes are even self-adhesive: take off the lid, place the trunking on the wall where you want it, slip the wires inside, replace the lid, job done.</p>  <p>For example: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00004W3ZQ">Amazon do this</a>.</p>

747		<p>While Jeremy's answer about the Wiremold products is a good one, for aesthetics I'd recommend the same manufacturer's <a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=911704&amp;Ntt=911704&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber" rel="nofollow">CordMate</a> product.</p>  <p>I've used both types, but in the house where people can see it, I prefer the look of the CordMate. The only drawback is that you can usually only run one cord through one CordMate (though two pairs of speaker wires will fit in one.) For instance, I've run two CordMate channels side by side down the wall from our wall-mount TV; one for power and one for the cable connection. I painted the CordMates when I recently repainted that wall, and they look good -- I think they're less noticable that the big Wiremold channels.</p>  <p>I've also used a CordMate at work to hide the Ethernet cable that runs down my office wall -- even unpainted, it's hardly noticeable.</p>
748		<p>@Jeremy has a good solution, but if you're willing to do a little more work, there is a little better-looking answer. Since you're running an HDMI cable, I assume you have some kind of small stand/table in front of the outlet that your cable box sits in or on.</p>  <p>With a drywall knife, punch out a hole behind the TV and install a plastic "old-work" 1-gang box. Don't worry, we're not going to install electrics here; just a plastic box that has a couple of "ears" on it so it can slide into existing drywall. Do the same thing at the bottom of the wall, above your electrical outlet. You can now run the cables easily through the wall without patching any drywall. If everything's laid out correctly, both will be hidden (one by the TV, one by the stand/table that holds your cable box).</p>
749		<p>If the nails are loose and pull out easily, just pounding them back in won't help much.  </p>  <p>The best way to fix any kind of nail/screw hole where the screw or nail won't grip any more is like this:</p>  <ol> <li>Remove the screw/nail.</li> <li>Take some toothpicks and dip them in wood glue (e.g. tightbond).</li> <li>Stuff as many toothpicks into the hole as you can, snapping them off flush with the hole.</li> <li>Put the nail/screw back in (while the glue is still wet).</li> </ol>  <p>I find myself doing this most for loose door hinges, but it works for pretty much anything.  Once the glue dries, the result is better than new.</p>
750		<p>I can understand being concerned with running electrical, but low voltage is a snap, as you don't have to install boxes in the walls. </p>  <p>You can get the necessary equipment to install low-voltage wall plates at most home improvement stores.  You'll need the wall plate, the correct inserts for it (they make 'em for F connectors (cable TV), RJ45 (twisted pair ethernet), RJ11 (phone), RCA plugs, and some can take extra wide inserts for HDMI, blanks to fill in any holes you won't be using, and a wall insert thing (not sure what it's officially called; it goes into the wall cavity to give you something to screw the wall plate down to.</p>  <p>You hold the insert where you want it (which is anywhere there isn't a stud, pipes, or electrial), trace it on the wall, then cut out with a drywall saw.  Afix the insert.</p>  <p>You can then fish the lines through the wall cavity.  As we're not trying to go horizontal, you can just use a decent sized nut tied to the end of a piece of string.  Dangle it down, and grab it when it's at the lower hole.  If you're trying to get it into a very small lower hole, or it's not exactly lined up with the other one and your hands aren't small enough, bend a wire coat hanger into a hook to grab the string.  (note -- you want the string more than 2x the length you're going ... so you use one hand to wiggle the string if needed, while catching it with the other one.</p>  <p>Once you have the string fished through, tie the top end to something (you can temporarily place a bolt for the face plate into the wall insert, and tie off to that).  Remove the nut from the lower end and tie it onto the cables you're fishing.  Pull the string to bring the cables up.  Attach the cables to the inside of the prepared faceplate.  Bolt the faceplate to the wall.</p>  <p>Do whatever you need to do to terminate the stuff down below, and you're done.</p>  <p>...</p>  <p>Electrical is similar, but you have to put boxes in the wall which need to be attached to studs, so you have to plan your holes better.  Fishing is more difficult, as you're trying to get it into one of the holes punched out of the box.  (and I guess it's possible that there might be permit/inspection issues ... I'm not an electrician)</p>
751		<p>If you want to go the glue route, I'd recommend Gorilla Glue - it's water-activated, and intensely-difficult to get rid of once dispensed.</p>  <p>I'd also think about switch to screws if you could, <em>a la</em> <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/744/how-to-fix-gutter-nails-that-are-coming-out/746#746">Tester101</a>'s suggestion.</p>
752		<p>Maybe I'm just sloppy, but I've never bothered to caulk the seam on a doubled up joist with treated wood.  </p>  <p>There was one time I felt I needed to worry about that, but that was with a cantilevered deck using untreated wood.  In that case I just used aluminum flashing over the top of the joists.</p>  <p>I suppose if I were going to caulk it though, I would use a silicone caulk over a latex caulk since they generally adhere and hold up to water better (cleanup is messier, but it's a deck, so it probably doesn't matter).</p>
753		<p>You will probably never get the same prices as a professional as you don't buy as much as they do.</p>  <p>However, you can always try to hackle the price down. It's amazing how much you can save when you use some time. You should find the right places though, the all organized places with big catalogs is usually a hard place to get discounts. </p>
754	How can I clean out my gutters while still on the ground?	<p>My roof is taller than I'm comfortable getting on a ladder. I've got a couple weeds/trees starting to grow in them. Is there a tool that would somehow let me scrape or use water-pressure to clean the gutters?</p>
755	How can I repair the cool deck around the pool?	<p>In places around the pool the cool deck has flaked off and I can see the bare concrete. The previous owner tried to patch it in places but it looks horrible because the texture AND color don't match. </p>  <p>Is there some kind of cool deck spary texture, like the kind of texture you can get for drywall? Also, can I paint all of the cool deck and will it last more than a year?</p>
756	How do I fix stucco that is falling off of the walls?	<p>I have slump block walls that were covered in stucco at some point and now in places it's falling off. I know I need to power wash the wall and then use some kind of bonding agent so the new stucco will stick to the old wall but how do I apply the stucco? I feel like going from the skip trowel stucco look to the adobe look but that's a lot of walls to cover just to avoid learning how to do it the skip trowel way.  Suggestions?</p>

762	Where should my furnace filter go in a Lennox G40UHX series furnace?	<p>I have a <a href="http://www.lennoxcommercial.com/products/heating/G40UH/">Lennox G40UH(X) series furnace</a>, which is installed in our attic (We have a single-story house on a slab). Because the furnace is installed in the attic, it is "laying down" on its side, and the incoming air is piped into what would be the bottom of the unit if it was standing up. We have intake vents in almost every room of the house (small vents, about 12" long by 8" tall). These vents go up to the attic, and they're all routed into a big metal box which is appears to be welded to the bottom of the furnace.</p>  <p>Because this is kind of hard to imagine, I mocked up a little image of my setup (this isn't my actual furnace, just a similar picture I found on Google):</p>  <p><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img441/787/furnace.png" alt="furnace mockup"></p>  <p>I have flexible ducts leading to the cold air intake "box" that is welded to the bottom of the furnace, and round flexible ducts leading from the hot air "box" to all of our vents (which are in the ceiling).</p>  <p>The problem I am having is that I can't see where to install a filter! I can remove the front panel and see the bottom motor, but there's no where to actually put a filter.</p>  <p>According to the <a href="http://www.lennox.com/pdfs/manuals/Lennox_G40UH_Manual.pdf">User's Information Manual</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This unit is not equipped with a filter or rack. A field-provided high-velocity filter is required for the unit to operate properly. A filter must be in place whenever the unit is operating</p> </blockquote>  <p>I don't have any idea what a "field-provided filter" is. When we bought the house, there were a few destroyed filters in the attic next to the furnace (all of different sizes, a few cut to different sizes, but no filter in the furnace. It looks like the previous owners had no idea either. So, for now, we've just been running the furnace without any filter.</p>  <p>Is there something I can do to put a filter in? Is it really harmful to run the furnace without one? Should I look into putting filters in all of my little air intakes around the house?</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> As is usually the case with me, I put off worrying about the furnace until it started getting too cold here at night. I finally climbed up to the attic and took a good look at the furnace. There isn't any indication of where a filter should go, and no slot to slide it in or bar to hold it in place.</p>  <p>This is the air intake area - you can see the circulating fan on the right, behind the control board:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/O7jvV.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>I put the filter along the bottom - a 14x25x1 fit snug across the whole side (bottom if it was standing up). I had to fold and bend the filter some to get it inside the furnace. The only thing that seems to hold it in place is the body of the circulating fan:</p>  <p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SWrpL.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
763	Fitting glass fibre loft insulation - recommended eye protection	<p>I've tried various goggles (some with more ventilation than others) and resorted to swimming goggles, but they all steam up after 60 seconds at the most.

764	Is it normal to install (pvc) decking like hardwood flooring?	<p>Forgive me I'm a newb.</p>  <p>We have become the proud owners of a new deck. One of the features that we thought was great was that the boards are installed fairly snugly and diagonally nailed into joists like hardwood flooring. However, I'm used to seeing decking installed with screws nailed into joists from the top. </p>  <p>Is the method my contractor chose normal? Will boards be popping up on me in the years ahead?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong> I'll add that there is some spacing between boards, just not as much as I am used to seeing. Maybe on the order of a 1/8 inch spacing.</p>
765		<p>Usually the filter is mounted between all the return ducting and the furnace itself - potentially it is installed at a strange angle or covered up with tape or something. Here is a picture of mine, it's the darker colored piece the duct is attached to, with foil tape sealing it to the furnace housing. </p>  <p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2hIn1.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2hIn1.png" alt="pic of furnace filter housing"></a></p>
766		<p>You can have a blower-door test done (or rent a blower and do it yourself). Basically you close all your doors/windows, and then stick a big fan in your doorway (sealed), then have it blow air outside. It creates negative pressure inside your house, amplifying any air leaks. I had this done as part of an energy audit (and when it was fairly cold outside), and just walked around using my hand to feel for any leaks (they are pretty obvious, because it is like a jet of cold air shooting in).</p>

770		<p>I found that when it comes to decks, you're always going to have boards popping up if you're using nails. The fact is that screws form a much much better bond and are much harder to come loose than nails. In fact, I just helped my brother in law redo his deck with screws instead of nails because of boards sticking up.</p>  <p>Some contractors use nails because it is faster and cheaper than doing the same with screws, and it'll be a few years before the owner has to redo anything. When it comes time to repair, use screws.</p>
771		<p><strong>Temporary fix:</strong> You can tightly wrap a rubber band around the pipe.  Since there is no pressure in the drain pipes, that will work just fine, unless the pipe gets clogged and filled up with sewage (and even in this case the pressures would be small enough for such a fix to work).</p>  <p>My parents' apartment has a cracked cast iron kitchen drainage pipe.  The rubber band was placed there more than 20 years ago: still works.  You shouldn't probably try to beat this record :)</p>
772		<p>Just call or e-mail them and ask for a better price.  More often than not you'll get a discount.  Works on appliances, materials, parts and everything else.  Exception: big chain stores.</p>  <p>My better half does this for most of the things we buy for the house.  Maybe her voice plays a role here -- hard to say :)</p>
773		<p>I'm going to assume that your decking isn't standard 5/4 (1" thick) treated pine, because it would be impossible to nail it down that way -- hardwood flooring planks are nailed along one edge, but the other edge is held down by a tongue and groove joint between it and the previous course of flooring planks.  Simply nailing each course of standard (non tongue &amp; groove) deck boards as you describe would leave the "trailing" edge of each board completely unsupported.</p>  <p>So I'm guessing that what you have is a composite deck or one made of an exotic wood, where there's either a tongue &amp; groove between each board, or each board is grooved to accept an hidden fastener.  Either way your deck should have a longer, more trouble-free life than a standard deck that's face-nailed.</p>

777		<p>I would not build a deck that way for a couple of reasons.</p>  <p>First, decks should have some space between the boards for drainage.  Otherwise water pools, accelerates rotting of the wood and makes the deck slippery.</p>  <p>Second is expansion.  Given that outdoor boards are alternately soaked and baked, there is significant shrinking and expanding of the boards (another reason for gaps).  That will be most pronounced in the width of the board versus the thickness. As the board expands it pulls out the nail.  If the nail is pounded into the edge it will pull out more since there is more expansion in that direction compared to a vertical nail.</p>  <p>Screws don't pull out at all, and that's their principle advantage and why I always screw down deckboards. Nails are preferred by many, but I haven't seen them nailed into the edge, and I think it's for good reason.</p>  <p>Edit: if it's a composite as others have suggested, everything I just wrote is a waste of pixels.  Unread it.</p>  <p>Edit 2: Turns out that this product is PVC plastic, and uses a HIDfast hidden fastening system <a href="http://www.hid-fast.com" rel="nofollow">Fastener System</a>,  <a href="http://azek.com/azek-deck/installation.html" rel="nofollow">Azek decking product installation videos</a>.  The product is also tongue and groove.  Sounds like the contractor did a good job.</p>
778		<p>I had this issue too. Bled the system once myself, twice with professional plumbers who kept telling me that i didn't do it correctly. Cost me an arm and a leg. The worst part was when i asked a "plumber with 25 years of experience" where the air is coming from he couldn't explain it. Some people were saying it's because i have an old type of expansion tank with the air, others were saying that the water from the city comes with some air.</p>  <p>What solved it is installing "Spirovent Air Eliminator". Not a sound this winter and i could finally sleep without hearing a waterfall.</p>  <p>P.S. Got a few more opinions on <a href="http://forum.doityourself.com/archive/index.php/t-375193.html">this forum</a></p>
779		<p>I used to buy my appliance parts at <a href="http://www.amresupply.com" rel="nofollow">Amre Supply</a>, and never bought anywhere else, so this is only one data point.  But one time I was flirting with the checkout girl and she said "you know, if you make a business account you'll get about a 40% discount on nearly everything".  All it took was an online application and a business card, which I had for my computer software business.  I just checked the "other" box on the "what kind of business" question.</p>  <p>After that, I just identified by business name and got the discount.  </p>  <p>And lest you think it was my James Bond Socializing Skills that got me a business account, I just printed the application online and brought it in, about a month later, where it was handled by a 67 year old retired plumber.</p>  <p>So maybe you just need to pick one place and ask if they have business accounts.  Ya never know.</p>
780		<p>I don't know if this is common or not, but in our current house and our previous house, the filter is in the return vent inside the house.  The vent grate has two little latches that allow it to swing out of the way, revealing the filter.  To check if yours is like this, just look for the latches and/or look through the vent slots and see if you see a filter.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I should have read your post a little more carefully, I didn't notice you mentioned "all my little air intakes."  So clearly you don't have just one return vent that could be housing a filter.</p>  <p>At any rate, if a filter were present it would have to be between the return box at the left of your diagram and the unit itself.  The installer should have built a gap in there to accept a filter, just like in gregmac's photo (but preferably this would be a slot rather than needing to be taped in!).  If you're not seeing something like this I'd recommend modifying it, or having someone do it if you're not comfortable doing it.</p>
781		<p>I've never had much luck with goggles.  I just use the regular safety glasses that look like sunglasses.  Should provide enough eye protection for doing fiberglass insulation anyways.</p>
782		<p>Depending on how and where it broke it going to affect what you can use.  I'm going to assume you're not looking for a suggestion of duct tape.</p>  <p>For long straight sections, where I had to cut a pipe, I've used <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0031R9GPY" rel="nofollow">rubber pipe connectors</a>.  You just slip it on one side of the break, align the pipes, and slip it over the break and tighten down the hose clamps.</p>  <p>There also exist <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00383YKCU" rel="nofollow">pipe wraps that harden</a> to do temporary repairs, that you can find in most hardware stores, but I've never used it.</p>  <p>I've used <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000BRQ0TW" rel="nofollow">epoxy putty</a> when I had a leak right at a coupling, so I wasn't able to get wrap something tightly right where it was.  You just knead it together, press it into the leak, and wait for it to set up.</p>
783		<p>Monoprice has a <a href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=104&amp;cp_id=10425&amp;cs_id=1042505&amp;p_id=4652&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2">complete kit</a> that will allow you to cut two holes in the drywall, and then get power and also run your signal cables vertically. I believe you need to install an 'old work' (aka 'retrofit') box for the power side, but that is pretty straight forward. <img src="http://images2.monoprice.com/productlargeimages/46521.jpg" alt="front view"></p>  <p>Once you cut the holes, these things fit in, and have wings that tighten down onto the drywall. <img src="http://images2.monoprice.com/productlargeimages/46522.jpg" alt="rear view"></p>
784		<p>This depends on how patient you are. My personal experience with plaster and stucco is that this is definitely one of those jobs best left to a professional: they'll cover in an hour what a beginner would take two days for. </p>
785		<p>In the UK, it's <strong>not legal</strong> (quite correctly, in my view) for householders to work on gas pipework or fittings <strong>at all</strong>. </p>  <p>If a buildings inspector or surveyor spots pushfit fittings on gas you can expect plenty of trouble down the line... to say nothing of the risk of a pinhole leak or if there's another fire nearby that melts the fitting.</p>  <p>While you might save a few pounds in the short term, do you want to risk your life and that of those around you? A leaky joint in a water pipe might wreck a ceiling or a floor, the same in a gas pipe might kill you. </p>  <p>Head <a href="http://www.trustcorgi.com/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details of the Gas Safety scheme which holds a register of tradespeople who can do the work for you. </p>
786		<p>Preparation is all important for this kind of work.</p>  <p>You need to make sure you remove <strong>all</strong> of the loose stucco because if you don't it will affect the finish and durability of the repair. My approach would be to use a wide cold chisel and lump hammer to go beyond the loose areas into the area that's still sound a little way.</p>  <p>If you get a good stable surface then there shouldn't be a problem getting the stucco to stick.</p>  <p>One point to consider - if you call a professional they'll have all the right tools and the experience, whereas this will be a learning experience for you and to do a good job you might end up spending almost as much on the tools (though they can be hired).</p>
787	How do I safely and cleanly remove sealant from a plastic bath?	<p>I really need to replace the sealant around the bath, but I want to do a good job of removing the old stuff first.</p>  <p>The bath is a plastic one, and the walls are tiled.</p>  <p>What's the best way to get the old stuff off without leaving any residue or damage, so that fresh sealant can be applied?</p>
788	Is it ok to screw into a steel door?	<p>I am looking to hang some blinds over the window on my front door.  Is ok to screw the mounting hardware directly into the door?</p>
789		<p>You might have to resort to good old fashioned elbow grease.</p>  <p>The sealant should come off the tiles the easiest, both mechanically by scraping with a plastic edge - the flat edge of an adhesive spreader should be suitable, and if necessary chemically (though I'm not 100% certain what you can use) as the glazed surface will hard to damage.</p>  <p>The plastic bath might cause more problems. I'd start with rubbing or scraping with the plastic edge - but take a lot more care. Chemicals are more likely to damage the surface too. You could try using a plastic safe cleaner.</p>
790		<p>Should be fine, just be careful not to poke a dent in the exterior skin when you pre-drill.</p>
791		<p>I'd use self tapping screws with a very small pilot hole.</p>
792		<p>Note that by code you're not allowed to run a device power cord behind the drywall.  So if you want to stay in code (and there are many good reasons for doing so), then your two options are going to be either 1) conceal these cables on the outside of the wall using a surface-mount conduit as suggested by Jeremy McGee and Gordon Brandly, or 2) install a power outlet in a standard (non low-voltage) old-work box behind the TV.  </p>  <p>Personally I like gregmac's solution -- you'd still need to install two standard boxes and run a bit of romex up the wall, but you don't need to run it across the wall and tie it in to an existing outlet for power.  The electrical skill needed for this would be similar to replacing a light fixture -- a couple of wire nuts and a couple of screw terminals.  You can do it!  </p>  <p>The extension cord will look a little funny running from one outlet to another on your wall, but hopefully that'll be concealed by whatever furniture you have below.</p>
793		<p>I bought a kit similar to <a href="http://www.lowes.com/ProductDisplay?partNumber=185393-1168-5860&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;productId=3064329&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;cmRelshp=sim&amp;rel=nofollow&amp;cId=PDIO1" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and it worked rather well for both removing the old caulk and reapplying the new. It's plastic, so you shouldn't have to worry about scratching anything up with it.</p>
794		<p>Sounds like the unit doesn't hold the filter. It must be custom installed right between the return duct and the unit. You'd think the hvac guy would leave some kind of access panel. Mine is just like @gregmac's picture, except I can get at the filter on the opposite side via the blower access panel.</p>  <p>Your going to circulate a lot of dust without a filter.</p>
795		<p>It's definitely not a problem.  As @ChrisF mentioned, the best way is to drill a small pilot hole (1/8" would probably be about right) and use a self-tapping screw.  </p>  <p>"Self tapping screws" suggest that you don't need a pilot hole, but they're really meant for sheet metal.  They'll never get started in the steel skin of your door.  A small hole will let them engage.</p>  <p>Drilling steel is not like drilling wood.  Please forgive me if this is too basic, but someone else might find it useful.  </p>  <p>To drill the hole, first locate where you want it with a pencil.  Then use a center punch with a hammer to tap a small indent right where you want the hole.  If you don't have a center punch use a nail.  <strong>If you don't tap a center mark, your drill will skate right across the surface of the door and scratch the paint</strong>.  </p>  <p>Then drill at the full speed applying some pressure directly behind the drill motor, in line with the twist drill.(1)  If you're used to drilling wood you might be surprised how much pressure it takes.</p>  <hr>  <p>(1) A bit (ha ha) of anal-retentive vocabulary: the thing that you plug in is the "drill motor".  The thing that actually drills, which most people call the "bit", is not a bit, it's a drill, usually a "twist drill".  I only bring this up because the the anonymity of the interwebs makes me bold.</p>
796		<p>At my old house, there wasn't a slot to put the filter into. Taking the door off the side showed me the motor, like you've said, which was situated inside the cold air return chamber (much like your picture). The filter rested on two notches on the outer edge of the chamber, and basically blocked my view of the motor. See if there's a way to place the filter "in the way" of the cold air as it passes the motor.</p>  <p>This disgusting image shows how the door opens to reveal the motor, and the air filter is placed at an angle in the way of the motor. Air flows from above and hits the angled filter.</p>  <p><img src="http://inspectapedia.com/aircond/AirFilter030DJFs.jpg" alt="furnace picture"> (<a href="http://inspectapedia.com/aircond/Air_Filter_Location.php" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>
797		<p>Another approach is to avoid drilling at all and use a magnetic curtain rod.  These are reasonably priced and stick well to the steel door without damaging it.</p>
798		<p>Usually bathtub caulking is silicone caulk, which can be a bear to clean off.  You can usually peel off most of it, but smudges and remnants remain and I know of no solvent to remove cured silicone.</p>  <p>One tip I read somewhere (I have never tried it) is to use a drafting eraser - you know, the white kind with the paper sleeve.  Apparently it will remove the smudges and last bits of clinging caulk.  If you try this, report back on how well it worked!</p>
799		<p>This is a <a href="http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infxtra/infcau.html" rel="nofollow">great article on how to remove the different types of caulk</a>.  It also talks about the pros and cons of different types of caulks when you reseal.</p>  <p>From the article:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Silicone caulk can be removed with a   sharp, single-edged razor in a razor   blade holder.  Be very careful to keep   the razor angled low so that you don't   scratch the tub or shower pan,   especially if it is a plastic or   fiberglass. A utility knife can also   be used to cut the caulk from between   the tiles and the tub if the razor   can't quite get it out, especially in   deeper pockets and corners! Sometimes,   if you have a porcelain tub, little   black lines will appear on the   porcelain as you scrape off the caulk,   even though you know you didn't   scratch the surface. These marks   usually come off with the alcohol   wipe. If they don't, use a little   scouring powder or Soft Scrub... with   a minimum of water.</p> </blockquote>
800		<p>I would start on the wall with the window above the tub. You should lay out a row of tiles on the ground as they would go on the wall. You'll want to pay attention to how the grout line will line up with the sides of the window and center accordingly. You always want the cut tiles in the corners where they will be hidden. Then start tiling from the tub up. </p>  <p>Is this a wooden window sill in a shower? If so, you might want to think about removing the wood and tiling the window as well.</p>
801	How do I balance a ceiling fan?	<p>About a year ago I installed a new ceiling fan in my living room and when it was installed it was balanced nicely, but it has a little wobble.  How do I bring it back in to balance?</p>
802	How do I re-level and re-lay a brick pad with a french drain underneath?	<p>I have a french drain that is under a brick pad just outside of my walk-out basement.  As you can see in the pic, the bricks have settled and some have even sunk, making the floor uneven.  I want to rip out all of the bricks, re-level and re-lay them.  </p>  <p>Any suggestions on doing it right?</p>  <p><img src="http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/6761/photoyva.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
803		<p>Have you tried cleaning the blades?  At high speed, just the dust buildup (which can be significant) on the blade edges can cause a bit of a wobble.</p>
804	Can a house with moldy, flooded basement be a likely fixer upper?	<p>I recently viewed a vacant house for sale that was nice except that the partially finished basement got flooded just enough to saturate the carpets and cover every piece of drywall, door, and trim with nasty black mold.  It was even on the concrete on the unfinished side.</p>  <p>It's clear the sump backed up from the recent storm and no one knew the pump quit.  I was considering what it would take to bring this house back into shape.  If I bought it, I'd certainly have a mold abatement specialist look at it.  If the report shows the mold didn't spread beyond the basement, would I expect to run into any issues by simply demolishing the finished area's carpet, drywall and framing and then bleaching all the remaining surfaces?</p>  <p>In other words, assuming no further flooding the house may become livable but will the basement always smell funny?  What are the chances mold can come back in the bad way?  Would there be any long term health risks after the cleanup?</p>
805		<p>I agree with Jeff's comment on this one. Once the mold smell is in there it's hard to get rid of. I've been in houses with moldy basements and they tried to use bleach to clear it up. The bleach cleaned out the mold but the smell still lingered.</p>  <p>One thing you COULD try (and I'm not saying this'll work) is to hire a company that specializes in flood or crime scene cleanup. They have chemicals that can probably get rid of the mold smell for you. I'm not sure about the expense involved (I doubt it will be cheap) but it just may work for you.</p>
806		<p>Yes, I'd insulate: not least because the water in the pipe will stay warmer longer. Although PEX is a better insulator than copper, having hotter water come through the pipe faster is a good thing.</p>
807		<p>Three things come to mind.</p>  <ul> <li>The easiest and probably first thing to try is clean it (as Eric suggests).</li> <li>Make sure all the bolts and screws are tight, this may require taking the fan down and reinstalling it. </li> <li>If the fan was not properly secured when it was installed (it was mounted to an existing electrical box), the fan could have loosened the screws/nails holding the box to the rafter/ceiling which could cause the fan to wobble and fall.</li> </ul>  <p>When installing ceiling fans I always use one of these <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ1xil/R-202049572/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053" rel="nofollow">braced boxes</a>.  They have some that are for new work, or where you have access to the attic. They also make ones for old work, where you can put the brace up through the hole and tighten it down until it bites into the rafters.</p>
808	What is the purpose of a sump pump?	<p>If you have a sump pump in your house/basement, does it mean you have (or potentially could have) a flooding problem?</p>
809		<p>Yes, generally you'll have a sump pump if the water table could reasonably rise to the level of the bottom of the basement.</p>  <p>The sump pump is most often used in combination with a drainage system around the foundation that directs water into a "sump pit".  The sump pump then pumps water out of the sump pit once it rises to a certain level.  If you have city sewer service, the water is usually pumped into the sewer system.  If not, it's usually just pumped up through a PVC pipe and out into the yard.</p>
810	How do I replace a bulb in this bathroom light/fan? 	<p>Can figure out how to open it.<img src="http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/2743/img4094s.jpg" alt="alt text"> Maybe somebody has a similar one.</p>
811		<p>Try turning the glass and see if it has hooks that hold it in place (kind of like how a smoke detector hangs onto that plate on the ceiling).</p>
812		<p>Might be clips around the perimeter.  Try running a butter knife or some kind of shim around the outside to see if you hit anything: if you do try poking in on it.</p>
813		<p>Cleaning and tightening will probably do the trick, if not some blades have a bit of adjustment in them.  Failing that...</p>  <p>One time I left the fan on in my parent's cabin for six months after I had a party there.  When we got back it was still going but vibrating like it had a missing blade.</p>  <p>My dad, bless his heart, just rolled his eyes and told me to deal with it: he'd only get mad at me if I couldn't fix it.  I tightened everything I could but it didn't help.  Finally I tried taping a rock to the top of each blade in turn.</p>  <p>I tried each blade: the third of four seemed to cut down on the vibration a bit.  So I started taping pennies to to that blade.  At around 10 pennies the vibration was minimal.  Couldn't get it better than that, but it was good enough that my dad said "Ok, don't be such an idiot next time" instead of walloping me.</p>
814		<p>Mine has spring-loaded clips shaped something like this: </p>  <p><img src="http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/2968/diyclip.png" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>The glass cover hooks onto the base of the clip, and when it's all assembled, the lower wide spots pull the glass cover up firmly against the surround.  To open it, I have to pull down firmly on the glass (there are a couple of indentations on opposite sides to give you a grip) to get past the resistance of the first wide part of the clips.  Once it's down, the glass hangs from the second wide parts, about an inch below the surround.  Then I just undo one of the clips to get at the bulb.</p>
815		<p>On some fans, the metal arms that hold the blades have some bend in them. </p>  <p>I've balanced fan blades by just bending them slightly up or down and doing a lot of trial and error. Just be careful not to break them.</p>
816		<p>Most new fans comes with a balance kit. It includes a heavy clip and a set of stick-on weights.  If you don't have the balance kit you can buy one at a big-box home improvement store.</p>  <ol> <li>First, run the fan at each speed to see where it wobbles worst. </li> <li>Put the clip on one of the blades near the middle and run the fan at that speed.</li> <li>Check if the wobble improves or worsens.</li> <li>Repeat the process with each blade, and narrow it down to the blade that gives the most improvement.</li> <li>Now, try moving the weight towards     the tip of the blade and down to the     hub, testing each time you move to     locate the sweet spot.</li> <li>Finally, attach the weight at that sweet     spot.</li> </ol>
817		<p>There are two reasons to insulate hot pex pipes:</p>  <ol> <li>Keep them hot in cold temperatures</li> <li>Keep them from heating up cold pex pipes</li> </ol>  <p>When we ran our pex, we were very careful to keep the hot and cold pipes from touching, so #2 wasn't an issue.  In my climate, I was more concerned with keeping the cold pipes from freezing and insulated them, particularly where they were near the exterior of the house or where they crossed near a cold air intake/vent.</p>
818	Do above counter bowl sinks require special cabinets?	<p>I am currently renovating a bathroom.  In the process, I'll be replacing the ugly 1970s vanity with a new craftsman style cabinet, solid surface countertop, and two above counter glass bowl sinks.  However, I am getting a bit concerned about the sink height, as the sink will no longer be set into the vanity.  How is this typically dealt with?  Standard height cabinets?  Special cabinets that are lower/designed for these sinks?  Something else? </p>
819		<p>Maybe the outer ring comes off first? Either twist or pull down to release clips. Then you could get at the light cover.</p>
820	What is an affordable 2D drafting software for amateurs?	<p>Background: We have about 1500 feet of unfinished basement that I am <em>contemplating</em> finishing off into a "grandma suite". Before getting serious about the project, however, I would like to play around with some layouts. </p>  <p>My first thought was to download the 30-day trial of <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13706292">AutoCAD LT</a>. But surely there must be some software that's better suited to a casual user, and doesn't cost $1200. Right? </p>  <p><strong>What are some affordable alternatives to AutoCAD for people who need to use drafting software very infrequently?</strong></p>
821		<p>There is a <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/4019/is-there-a-web-app-for-automatically-drawing-house-plans-from-a-set-of-measureme">question on WebApps</a> for web applications to do this.</p>
822		<p>It's not 2D, but have you considered <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Google Sketchup</a>?  It has a bit of a learning curve, but can be quite powerful.  And of course it is free.</p>
823		<p>They're typically used on standard height cabinets, but have the effect of making the bowl higher. Here's another question that deals with <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/569/bathroom-vanity-height">bathroom vanity height</a>.</p>
824		<p>The best thing to do is not to have it drain under the patio -- when you change the moisure content of soil, it can compact differently, or wash out, both of which could cause the problems you're seeing.  If you can, change the drain there so you're using non-perforated pipe, and run it out further to a drainage field past the bricked area.</p>  <p>The problem is, you want to compact the soil for the patio, which will reduce the air voids in the soil, making it less permeable and not drain as well, making the french drain less effective.</p>  <p>As it's bricked, if you slope it away from the house, you'll reduce the amount of water absorbed in that area, which should hopefully eliminate the need for a french drain to collect the water to take down to a drainage area.</p>  <p>If you want to get the best compaction of your soil, dig some if it out, then compact the soil, then add a few inches back in, compact again, then repeat until you're out of soil.  Then repeat for the base pack, check it for level and then start laying your pavers. </p>
825	What material should I use for a custom, do-it-yourself desk for my home office?	<p>I am currently remodeling my office, a converted formal dining room, and I am stuck on what material to use for the desktop.</p>  <p>Currently I have a 1" thick Cherry Veneer particle board that is 6' wide x 30" deep.</p>  <p>I want to increase the depth slightly (I like to rest my elbows on the desk while gaming) and am finding it hard to decide on a good material for a 36" depth that has an attractive finish. I would be happiest with a black veneer on the top (non-shine).</p>  <p>Any suggestions, or even places to purchase or order in Orange, CA would be awesome.</p>  <p>I am not shy in building one either, if anyone has any suggestions on the construction of a strong top.</p>
826		<p>There is also <a href="http://www.homestyler.com/">Autodesk Homestyler</a> (beta).  I have not used it and it looks like a competitor to Google Sketchup (so not 100% 2D) but looks like it might give you want you want when laying out your basement.</p>
827		<p>Have you looked at getting some thick particle board and laminating on a veneer yourself? That will be less limiting in your color choices than trying to find pre-finished tops.</p>
830		<p>If the vanity is so small that it just supports the bowl but with no usable countertop, then the vanity is often lower than standard by 8" or so.  </p>  <p>But if there is usable space on the counter than it's more important to have that work space (shave space?) at a comfortable height than it is to have the top of the sink at a standard height.</p>
831		<p>If you want to build your own you would need to use a hard wood such as oak, cherry, or walnut.  You would then join all of the suitable length pieces together to give you the width you want (36" allowing for a little extra for milling).  Then you would cut it to size and sand and finish it.  Although this would take some learning/knowledge and also a fair bunch of new tools :).  </p>
832		<p>Particle board or some form of fiber board or plywood will eliminate the issues you might have with solid wood warping. If you veneer the top surface, you should veneer the bottom as well to avoid the veneer warping the board if it shrinks or expands on only one surface. Remember to treat the top and bottom the same (varnish, oil, or other).</p>  <p>Another thing that helps reduce warping is strips or batons. When screwed through slots in the batons into the underside of the desktop, it will allow the top to expand and contract, yet still be held flat.</p>
833	Are there solar lights that can be put inside existing lamps?	<p>We've got lamp posts in the garden that we're fond of, but the electrics were not very well installed (by the previous owner I might add). I've disconnected the electrics and would like to put a solar bulb or mass of LED lights inside the lamp houses with the charger discretely stuck in the ground nearby.</p>  <p>Are there lamps I can buy online or in the UK that would be suitable? If none are suitable, I might create a birds nest of an LED string of lights inside the lamp housing. Would that provide enough light?</p>
836		<p>There are many factors to take into consideration when talking energy efficiency and comfort. Your comfort level may like a house at 69F in the winter, but other members of the household may feel "chilled to the bone". Also, the quality and efficiency of the insulation in each region (outer walls, door seals, attic/roof insulation, etc) will have a direct bearing on any energy efficiency values.</p>  <p>Another factor to consider, which recommendations usually take for granted, is what is the usage of each floor, and are both floors above ground or is it a 1st/main floor and a basement?</p>  <p>For example, if the upstairs contains only rooms which are used primarely in the evenings and at night, they can typically stay a little warmer during the day in the summer, since the majority of the time isn't spent there, just as keeping a living/media room warm overnight in the winter typically isn't necessary... unless there is a reason to (plants, temperature sensitive equipment, etc).</p>
837	What are some good downspout options for a brick house?	<p>I need to replace the gutters and downspouts on my house, and I'd like to know the best approach.</p>  <p>The house is 100 year-old clay brick house. The old gutters were aluminum and used downspouts that sat on hooks embedded in the brick (with a series of notches on the back of the downspout), and were held against the house by pressure from the gutters at the top and being sleeved into pipes that run to the sanitary sewer main at the moment (we appear to be grandfathered into the system, but yes I know that's bad).</p>  <p>The gutters were pulled off and damaged by a snow storm, but most of the downspout parts are intact. One of the pipes that runs to the sewer is collapsed so we need to use a different system to remove the water from the base of the house at that corner.  I'd rather NOT put new holes in the brick if I don't have to, but all the local home improvement stores seem to see plastic gutter systems that use different mounts (brackets that wrap around the downspout to hold them against the house).</p>  <p>If I look around are there likely to be places that might have parts for aluminum gutters? Is trying to rebuild a system like we had the best idea or should I replace with something different?  If I did switch the gutters, is there a gutter system out there that might work with my old brackets so that I don't have to put new holes in the walls?</p>
838		<p>While I haven't build a space like you're describing, I have helped users of them and seen their designs.</p>  <p>If you are just trying to build a space that would allow the wheelchair user to shower, there are a <a href="http://www.themedicalclub.com/Handicap_Roll_In_Showers_s/28.htm?gclid=CL_8_oqalqMCFcpS2godjViBsA" rel="nofollow">number of products</a> that are designed to make this relatively easy to install. A quick search yielded the link above, but I'm sure there are other options out there. These are less elegant looking than most true wet rooms, but can be highly functional. During college I assisted a user of a shower like that, who thought they were relatively well designed except that the controls were not in a location a seated person with restricted arm movement could easily reach (something to keep in mind however you build it).</p>  <p>If you're building a larger space you'll need to grade most of the floor, particularly the area around the shower to avoid water pooling away from the drains or flowing toward the door. <a href="http://bathroom-decor.suite101.com/article.cfm/wet_room_design" rel="nofollow">This article</a> has some thoughts to keep in mind when designing the space. You can make a raised edge near the shower that a wheelchair can get over just make sure you don't make it too hard to get over.  I've also seen spaces designed with a ridge that runs across the room that didn't cause problems for wheelchair users, but caused water to run toward one of two drains in the floor.  The advantage of grading the entire floor as I understand it, is that you always control where the water is going, instead of hoping it stays put.  This can be problematic of people with balance issues if you're not careful.</p>
839	How can I fix a door that doesn't close because it doesn't fit the frame?	<p>Two closet doors in my house won't close all the way. When they are about 85% closed, it stops because the top of the door is rubbing up against the frames. It looks like I need to move the door down about <strike>3-6 inches</strike> a half inch. The doors are hollow except for about a foot on the top and bottom.</p>  <p>I want to avoid having to take the door and hinges off and redoing the hinges. Is there anyway I can avoid that? A step by step would be very helpful, even if there is no way to do it without moving the hinges.</p>
840		<p>I can't believe 3-6 inches is correct.  Maybe 3/16 of an inch? (even that is pushing it).</p>  <p>The easiest way to fix this is to take the door down and trim a bit off the top of the door.  I'll usually just run the door through my table saw to trim it down, but a power planer would probably work better if you have one.  Otherwise a hand planer will work too, but could take a while.</p>  <p>Be careful how much you trim off though.  You say the door is hollow except for about a foot at the top and bottom, but if it's like most hollow core doors these days, it's probably more like an inch at the top and bottom.</p>
841		<p>If you're having the same problem I had, and it's a case of rubbing but the door could be forced closed (so it's just slightly off), I just made a note of where it was rubbing with a bit of crayon (wipes off easily), then took a small hand plane to shave down that area slightly.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, I also made the mistake of passing off the plane to my house mate, who wasn't familiar with its use, and he ended up taking a chunk off of his bedroom door.  I have no idea how he managed to do it.  So, for using a plane -- you want long strokes, and try to shave the door off -- if it gets caught and starts splitting the grain, stop, move back further, and then lightly shave down past where you had the problem.</p>
842		<p>Rather than a slope, consider a little bit of a lip.  You'll need to consider who it is in a wheelchair, but if they can make it up a small bump, then add a higher threshold, and trim the door to give the necessary clearance.</p>  <p>You might also consider a bit of weatherstripping or similar, so that water can't easily get through the gap under the door.  (it doesn't need to seal that well, it can just be a small plastic flap on the inside of the door that comes down to meet the edge of the threshold.</p>
843		<p>You could maybe buy some cheap solar lamps, and tear them apart to use guts to replace your existing lamps, but my guess is you're going to have trouble mounting the solar panels somewhere that doesn't look goofy. If you mount them away from the lamp itself, then you're going to have to run wiring (and as you said, that was not done well and has been disconnected). If you're willing to run new wiring, then you can definitely use low voltage LED bulbs, where you just need low voltage cable that goes back to a transformer somewhere (or battery + solar panel) - this is much easier and safer to install than high voltage cable (where you pretty much need to run it in a conduit anywhere underground). </p>
844		<p>On some TV show I was watching, they showed the cleanup of a house with a severe mold problem.  The procedure was to strip everything back to the studs and subfloor and clean with a media-blaster.  Instead of sand, they used small dry ice pellets.  It basically took off the top layer of wood from the studs and rafters.  Since it was dry ice, there was no cleanup except the sawdust.  You are probably looking at doing something like this, and it won't be cheap.  </p>
845		<p>Is there some particular reason not to put new holes in the bricks? My first inclination is to just drill new holes, and secure the spouts properly - after all, they did come off during a snow storm. </p>  <p>Do you have pictures of the existing mounts? Perhaps there is a way to retrofit something onto the existing hooks but still use a modern downspout.</p>
846		<p>Besides cleaning and swapping fan blades, check to make sure it the down rod with the ball (if you have one) is properly seated in with the slot in the down rod ball with the tab in the bracket that goes to the fan box.</p>  <p>Your box is attached to a stud, right? Check to make sure your box did not come lose from the stud. This all will require you to take some or part of the fan down.</p>
847	Would putting a sprinkler on my roof help cool my home?	<p>Anyone ever put a sprinkler on your roof to help out your A/C on unusually hot days? Just wondering if it helps.</p>
848	How does central vacuum suction compare to regular vacuum?	<p>We recently moved into a new home with central vac. The vacuum unit is in the garage, as is typically the case, and seems to be in good working condition. I cleaned the "bucket" underneath and made sure the grid inside is free of dirt/lint etc.</p>  <p>It seems to me the suction when actually using the central vac system is not quite as powerful when compared to a regular vacuum. I can understand that the system is much "bigger" i.e lots of air in the pipes and much longer distance for particles to travel.</p>  <p>Is it expected that the suction should not be as strong as regular vac or am I dealing with a blockage or perhaps under spec vac?</p>
849		<p>The central vacs I've used have been more or less the same strength. If there's a remarkable difference, if it's really under-powered, then there's something wrong - either a blockage or too-small vac. But if it's nearly the same strength, just a little weak, there's probably nothing wrong.</p>
850		<p>Perhaps kitchen worktop is the way to go - plenty of choices in finish, thickness and size. Durable and hardwearing, too. </p>
851		<p>Seems like it would be a bit wasteful and not that efficient.</p>  <p>I'd imagine being on the roof, ambient temperature is much less of an issue then the constant sun exposure just baking the unit.  Like when I get in the car here in TX sometimes, ambient temperature is in the 90s but the car baking in the sun says its 110+.  If it were parked in the shade, it would read the normal temperature.</p>  <p>So I would think focusing on blocking as much sun as possible would be the best solution.</p>  <p>I'm picturing some sort of open sided mini roof structure, almost like a little car port over the unit or a well ventilated little shack built up around it.</p>  <p>These are just random crazy ideas of my own though, never heard of this issue nor a solution for it.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong><br> This is under the assumption the AC unit is what you are trying to cool, if it is the temperature of the roof you are wanting to reduce, I'd encourage considering @Vebjorn Ljosa's and @Jeff Widmer's answers over a water cooling solution.</p>
852		<p>I think you will just waste a lot of water compared to the cooling effect that you get.</p>  <p>A better way to cool the roof is to change its color.  A roof with a clean, smooth bright white surface can reflect about 85% of incident sunlight and emit thermal radiation with 90% efficiency. This surface  will be only 9Â°F warmer than the outside air on a typical summer afternoon. For comparison, the surface of a standard gray roof that reflects only about 20% of incident sunlight will be 69Â°F warmer than the outside air.  See <a href="http://coolcolors.lbl.gov/">http://coolcolors.lbl.gov/</a>.</p>  <p>Some buildings in California are now required to have light-colored roofs in order to reduce energy consumption for cooling. </p>
853		<p>I'm going to assume that the vaccuum was sized to the house, so it's not under-spec, although poor maintenance might mean that it's underperforming.</p>  <p>I'd suspect one of three things -- a blockage, a poorly performing pump, or a leak in the system.</p>  <p>If it's a blockage, unless it's right near the pumps, you'd have some areas with good pressure, and others past the blockage with poor pressure.  (and the pump would be straining to keep up).  You might be able to map out where a blockage might be by determining which ports have good suction, and which ones don't.</p>  <p>If it's a poorly performing pump, it's difficult to diagnose, but you might try listening for sounds of a straining motor and/or any odd smells.  (I'm not so good in this field, so can't really say much more, a bad seal could cause just as bad as a problem, and I don't know if there's a good way to test for that.).</p>  <p>If it's a leak somewhere, the whole system won't be able to come pressure, so you'll have poor pressure everywhere.  There might be additional dropoff at the leak if you were to try to map out which ports have worse suction than others, but as the suction is poor to start with, and some dropoff is standard for a pressuried system, it might be difficult to identify.</p>  <p>You might be able to better pinpoint a leak by intentionally clogging up the line, if it's run as a line with multiple ports off of it, rather than them all branching from one point.  You'll need a two-way radio, baby monitor, or something similar.  Put the transmitting end near the pump, and carry the receiving end with you.  Open up the port, and intentionally block the tube on the side heading towards the pump.  If there's no leak in that section, you should hear the pump straining.</p>  <p>Luckily, leaks are unlikely (unless perhaps if you've had an earthquake in that area), because I have no clue how you'd go about actually repairing it without tearing out the walls.</p>
854		<p>I buy replacement parts for my appliances online.  The best source I've found so far is</p>  <p><a href="http://www.repairclinic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.repairclinic.com/</a></p>  <p>I don't work for them, nor do I get referral fees, etc.  Off the top of my head I can remember   purchasing a replacement valve for my dishwasher (~$15,) sealed glass cook top for a range (~$110,) and an oven door handle for same range (~$25)  All these prices seemed very reasonable.  </p>  <p>Just make sure whomever you use has pictures of the parts online so you can match them before ordering, and a good return policy if you do end up ordering the wrong one.</p>
855	How do I clean the oven really well?	<p>I need to clean my kitchen's oven really well. It is electric, has a "grill" element on top, and a fan behind a grating which, apparently, cannot be removed. I tried with the spray products for ovens but I cannot reach every part of it, and I always have the sensation that I'm not cleaning, I'm just detaching oil but even after removing it with paper and cleaning more with alcohol, the oven stays oily anyway.</p>  <p>Do you have any hint on how to clean it as close as brand new, and what are the precautions to keep (if any) in order not to ruin the grill element ?</p>
856		<p>Alcohol isn't the best solvent for grease.  You're better off using dish soap in water.</p>  <p>A toothbrush is handy for cleaning hard to reach crevices and grates.</p>  <p>I'm surprised the grate doesn't come off. Look for clips along the edge (feel with a shim), and gently try to pry it off from the edge: many are just a friction fit.  You can try calling an appliance parts store with your brand and model: they'll have a manual so can tell you how to get the grate off.</p>
857		<p>Check all the cover plates to make sure they seal correctly when the vacuum is running.</p>
858	The carpet on my stairs is worn. Should I repair it or just remove it?	<p>In our house the second floor and the stairs to them have carpet over top of old hardwood floors (installed by previous owner).  The carpet is wearing out, particularly on the stairs where it has come untacked in a couple places so that when you go up or down them the carpet will at times slide forward creating a hazard we need to deal with. We can see under the carpet in a couple places and the floor looks okay, but not great.</p>  <p>Does it make more sense to remove the carpet and risk the condition of the floor underneath or try to tack the carpet back in place?  What would be involved with retacking it down? If the finish on the original floor is in poor shape, is it a problem just to leave it alone (assuming no splinter hazards)? Finally, if we remove the carpet, what will we need to do to remove the tacks and other carpet related things from the floors?</p>
860		<p>I love hardwood floors, so I would rip the carpet out and re-finish the hardwood if it wasn't in good condition.</p>  <p>If it's not, you can always put new carpet down.</p>
861	How do I get utility lines marked on my property?	<p>In Michigan, there is a service called Miss Dig for identifying buried utility lines. We've just moved from Michigan to New Hampshire, and we would like to know where our utility lines are buried. What service should I call?</p>
862		<p>A list of "Know Before You Dig" services, by state, is available here: <a href="http://www.call811.com/state-specific.aspx" rel="nofollow">811 Website</a></p>  <p>For New Hampshire, contact Dig Safe Systems, Inc.</p>
863		<p>Easy Off is a great product for cleaning the oven - but if you're sensitive to chemicals I'd use a respirator and gloves. (That's what I do)</p>
864		<p>This question is really too localised, so this answer doesn't apply to all, but in Australia there's Dial Before You Dig on <code>1100</code></p>
865	Will I be able to replace the tub and shower fixtures in my [apartment] home myself?	<p>I live in a roughly-50 year-old apartment building and would like to renovate the bathroom myself. I've tiled and replaced sinks and toilets in the past, but I'm unsure about replacing the tub and shower fixtures (knobs, spouts, etc.). Will I be able to shut off water to the tub without needing to shut off water in my whole line of apartments? I can find a [third] valve underneath the neighboring sink that appears to control the hot water flow to the tub, but no clues about the cold water.</p>
866		<p>If this is for a building with windows that open, I'd think instead about sprinklers/lawn/misters at ground level - my house has no A/C but we get a reasonable north-south breeze, and if I turn on the sprinklers on the north side of the house and open the windows, there's a noticable cooling effect.</p>  <p>In high desert country, it's not unusual for restaurants with outdoor seating to install mist delivery systems to cool the outdoor areas during the hot parts of the day.</p>  <p>Ultimately, the value of evaporative cooling is going to depend a lot on the relative humidity in your location - where the air is dry, evaporative cooling works nicely. If you are in a humid location, there's already plenty of moisture in the air, so you're not going to get much evaporation, and correspondingly not much cooling.</p>  <p>I have heard of people using roof-mounted sprinklers as a last line of defense in high fire danger areas - not sure how well it really works. </p>
867		<p>I'd go ahead and pull it up and see what you've got.  It sounds like it's in pretty poor shape so you're going to have to get rid of it either way.</p>  <p>Depending on how the carpet was installed you'll probably find tack strips that look something like like this:  <img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3aANd9GcS0fdUNUtD_Wn-72n_aZwB-8wBexFSLYso_Zh8aqF3thBGOgsM&amp;t=1&amp;usg=__DKiAzwawwxC1ekpvMy_ANxTqaIE=" alt="tack strip"></p>  <p>You might also find staples -- I don't know if this is common but our installer used a staple gun in some troublesome spots.  Most if not all of the staples will probably be pulled out when you rip out the carpet.</p>  <p>Before removing anything, take a look at the hardwood stair treads and make a preliminary decision about whether you think they're in good enough condition to leave exposed.  If they're really rough and/or you want to recarpet, leave the tack strips in place and hammer in the staples.</p>  <p>If you do want to leave the stairs uncarpeted, you can just remove the tack strips, being careful not to damage the floor underneath.  For minimal damage I'd recommend this type of prybar available at box stores for ~$14:</p>  <p><img src="http://images.lowes.com/product/converted/076174/076174555080lg.jpg" alt="prybar"></p>  <p>Use a hammer to tap the pointy claw end (like you would hammer a chisel) under the head of each nail holding the tack strip down, then pry up the nail enough that you can get your hammer's claw under it to pull it out.  No tools ever need touch your stair tread.</p>
868		<p>Related to @Vebjorn Ljosa's answer, you could also install solar panels on your roof.  Check out an organization called <a href="http://1bog.org/" rel="nofollow">One Block Off the Grid</a> (http://1bog.org/) if you are interested in putting solar panels on your own roof.  1Bog will help with getting a local contractor and depending on the state you live in, you could end up selling your energy credits back to other businesses for extra money.</p>
869		<p>Good windows are very important in New England. Growing up in an old house in New Hampshire I can tell you first hand that you can feel the heat getting sucked out the windows.</p>  <p>Now technically I don't know much about what makes a window energy efficient, but I do know that people who do know a lot about it give them an "ENERGY STAR" rating.  Home Depot will  let you filter by windows that have this rating, then you can sort by price.  This doesn't answer your entire question but will give you two of you're bullet points (cheap + energy efficient).</p>  <p>If you happen to live in Massachusetts you can give the people at <a href="http://www.masssave.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.masssave.com</a> a call and they'll come down and give you a free energy assessment, which I would guess include windows.</p>  <p>Finally, windows qualify for some of those government rebate programs. See: <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index" rel="nofollow">http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index</a></p>
870		<p>If the carpet is frayed, it will have to be removed anyway.  You can then decide whether to put new carpet on or refinish the wood floor.  Even if you end up hiring a company to sand and lacquer the floors, you can save hundreds of dollars by removing and disposing of the carpet, setting the nails, and doing any necessary repairs yourself.</p>  <p>We removed the carpet from the stairs and several upstairs rooms.  These were pine floors, but they had been carpeted at least since 1945 (dated by the newspapers used as carpet pads).  The downstairs rooms have old (some perhaps a century) and quite nice pine floors, and we were hoping for the same in the rest of the house.  While we are satisfied with the result overall, there were some disappointments:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Two small holes where the corners of floor boards have split off.  We placed furniture over them.</p></li> <li><p>Pieces of the floor had been replaced near old radiator leaks.  For the most part it looks fine, but in one place a board had been replaced with plywood.</p></li> <li><p>A <em>lot</em> of sanding was necessary.  I hired a company to do this.  The floors now go up a few millimeters near the walls, where the machines sanded less.</p></li> <li><p>Even after sanding, there are holes from staples and nails, especially on the stairs.</p></li> <li><p>Boards joined in funny places, perhaps because the location used to be covered by a doorway.</p></li> </ul>
871		<p>There would be a small door with a valve somewhere, either inside your apartment or elsewhere.  If each apartment is metered separately, there will likely be a valve by the water meter.</p>  <p>Even if the water needs to be shut off for the whole building, it will only be needed for a few minutes while you (or a plumber) removes the faucet and plugs the pipe, then again to attach the new faucet once you're done.</p>  <p>Some states (e.g., Massachusetts) require that most plumbing work be done by a plumber.  Call your local building department.</p>
872		<p>Have you checked whether it has a self-cleaning mode?  It can help burn off spots that you're not able to scrub off.</p>
873		<p>Ikea sells desk tops separately from the legs, perfectly suitable as building materials for your DIY super desk.  They are reasonably priced and available in many sizes and finishes.  There are several stores in the greater L.A. area.</p>
874		<p>Given that it's an apartment the plumbing would most likely have to be done by a licensed plumber, check with the landlord/building manager and local government.  </p>  <p>In some places the work can be done by anybody, but must be inspected at different stages by a licensed professional and/or the local government.</p>
875		<p>Take into consideration the expected users of the bathroom (not just current but future).</p>  <p>It sounds like this is probably your master and so will be focused on adults, so the raised height should be fine.</p>  <p>If this is a common area bathroom or connected to a secondary bedroom, even if you don't have children, you want to consider visitors and future re-sale so keeping the sink level at standard height would be best.</p>
876	How do I go about fixing an apartment buzzer?	<p>My apartment's buzzer has stopped working. I can use the intercom and buzz people in but if someone presses the button outside I hear nothing. What's likely the problem here and how can I go about fixing it?</p>
877		<p>I would report it to maintenance/landlord, it isn't something you installed to the unit so it isn't your responsibility to repair it.</p>  <p>Plus, the issue isn't even necessarily at the end in your unit, there could be a problem with the button at the front door, wiring issue between, etc.</p>  <p>Typically to test wiring issues you need access to both ends as you will need to loop one end and test conductivity from the other.</p>  <p>Aside from if the buzzer device itself went out, I'm not sure what you could fix on just your end, and that would require a part replacement that you don't need to pay for.</p>
878		<p>Plant an oak tree, wait 10-20 years, shade created, problem solved!</p>
879		<p>811 is the universal number for all US states.</p>  <p>Canada has different numbers.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.call811.com/state-specific.aspx" rel="nofollow">Listing here</a></p>
880		<p>I recently used <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_41327-68-10504_0_?productId=3033245&amp;Ntt=dap+stucco&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=/pl__0__s?newSearch=true%24Ntt=dap%20stucco%24y=0%24x=0" rel="nofollow">DAP All-Purpose Stucco Patch</a>. It comes in a tube too so you can just attach it to your caulking gun. It needs to be painted over. You need to repair those cracks so water does not get in and DAP will seal it along with a coat of paint. You'll need a plastic spreader to spread the mix.</p>
881	Hanging an interior door	<p>I reversed the doors to my bedroom (they're small "french" doors I guess but they don't have glass or open to the outside like normal french doors) so they open out instead of in (the room is small despite the big door opening).</p>  <p>Come to think of it there was a door missing when we bought the house (yes, it's been over a year and I'm just getting to fixing this door problem) so I had to buy a new one and it wasn't an exact match for what was there before so there is about a 1 inch gap between the doors that I figure I could fill in with a piece of wood and some sanding.</p>  <p>Anyway . . . after reversing the doors and hanging the new door the gap between the doors is different at the top than at bottom. I know that means something isn't level but I checked it with my four foot level before I attached the door frame and everything was fine. </p>  <p>Any tips to hanging interior doors? It looks so easy on TV!</p>
882		<p>I'd recommend look at the Low-Emissivity and Argon glass types. I recently installed them in my house. They are a little more expensive than regular windows, but they save on cooling and heating costs. My Low-E windows are double paned.</p>  <p>Also, look at good insulation and caulking on/around your windows.</p>
883	Can I use a swamp cooler to cool an AC unit's condenser?	<p>Swamp coolers work great and use a fraction of the electricity of an air conditioner in a dry climate with little humidity (like Phoenix) but there are downsides like mold and, well, everything feels wet in your house. Dry cool air is more comfortable than wet cool air. </p>  <p>Why don't the condenser units of a split system AC use water in some way to cool the condenser? Is it because the moist air would cause corrosion faster and the savings in electricity would be lost to the fact that you'd have to replace the unit? How do AC units in climates like Florida last more than a few years since it's humid all the time there?</p>
885	How often should I run a bleach and water solution through condensate lines?	<p>How often do you need to run a bleach and water solution through the condensate drain lines (of a heat pump) to keep the bacteria away? </p>  <p>What are the recommended parts (e.g. 1 part bleach, 10 part water)?</p>
886		<p>Check your level to make sure it's accurate.  Place it on a level (or nearly so) surface like your kitchen counter.  If the surface isn't exactly level then note the direction and degree to which it's off.  Then spin the level around end for end, without flipping it over.  The bubble should either be in the middle if it started in the middle, or it should be off by the same amount in the same direction as before (that's direction relative to the room, not relative to the level).  If that's not the case then your level is off and should be replaced.</p>  <p>It shouldn't be much harder than it is on TV, which is what makes me think your level is out of calibration.</p>
887		<p>Did you check the frame again after hanging the doors?  Could be that the frame wasn't securely attached to the studs and the weight of the doors is causing the frame to pull out slightly.</p>  <p>Also, maybe too late for this now, but you mentioned that the old frame was about an inch wider than the new one.  That seems a bit strange.  Is that the rough in dimensions, or the finished frame dimensions?  Usually the rough in is a couple inches or so wider than the actual door frame dimensions to give you some room to plumb things up with shims.</p>  <p>So if you had a 48" door set, the rough in width would be 50" - 48 for the door, 1 more for the frame, and 1 more for shimming.</p>
888		<p>Don't know the names off the top of my head, but I see all kinds of "DIY" room planning/drawing tools on the $9.99 shelf at places like OfficeMax.</p>
889		<p>Take the 4 foot level and check that the frame on both sides is still plumb when the doors are hung, then place the level on the edge of the door to check if the doors are hanging plumb.</p>  <p>make sure both doors are square, using a <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&amp;q=t-square&amp;cid=2386033431760671960&amp;ei=RCFXTL-AK5LqyQWR8LXYBA&amp;sa=title&amp;ved=0CAcQ8wIwADgA#p" rel="nofollow">T-square</a>.  Previous owners may have plained/sanded the doors to account for less then plumb door frames.</p>  <p>Make sure all the hinges are mounted to the same depth.  If one of the hinges is not in line with the other, it can cause the door to not hang properly.</p>
890	What's a good way to seal a flat concrete roof?	<p>My guess is that a long time ago there was a fire in part of our house and what was the top storey was capped and the floor replaced with thick slabs of concrete. This was then sealed over with bitumen and left as a flat roof, with traditional pitched roofs on either side.</p>  <p>Now, however, it seems something is failing and the roof has started to leak. It's always pooled water on the top to half an inch or so, but the last lot of heavy rain caused a stain on the ceiling underneath. That was easily redecorated, and I've made sure the drain to the gutter is properly free flowing now, but I don't want it to start again.</p>  <p>What's a good way to seal this roof so that doesn't happen again? I've used flash-band to patch up a couple of obvious cracks in the bitumen but I'd rather have something more permanent.</p>
891		<p>I'm not a big fan of particle board. It's not all that strong and you need to paint it and make sure that if it gets scratched you fix it right away before any water can penetrate. The plastic veneer on top of the particle board from IKEA is strong and would work but doing it yourself isn't easy or fun.</p>  <p>I like plywood with a nice maple or oak veneer with a solid wood border made to whatever thickness you want to see. You <em>can</em> paint it black but that would be wood murder. If you want to paint then get a cheaper plywood and edge it with Poplar (pine would work too but it's not much cheaper and it's softwood).</p>
892		<p>Probably not worth it.</p>  <p>Considering how much the insulation costs (not to mention install costs though this is diy so that should be $0) I think it would take a long time to make up for the cost of water that goes down the drain to get to the hotter water from the tank and well as the cost to heat that extra water to a temperature that the insulated pipe water would have been.</p>  <p>I would need (or technically, that guy from <a href="http://xkcd.com/" rel="nofollow">XKCD</a> would need):</p>  <ol> <li>water costs in your area</li> <li>Length and diameter of the pex from the tank to an average faucet</li> <li>average temperatures inside and outside your house and </li> <li>the percentage of the pex that is inside your house</li> </ol>
893		<ol> <li><p>Don't use alcohol to clean an oven.</p></li> <li><p>If your oven has a "self cleaning" mode, try that.  It basically puts the oven on full blast (2-3x the normal baking temperature) and "burns" all of the crud out.  Sometimes there will be some charred stuff behind that you have to wipe out after it is done (see #3).  Because of the extreme temperatures involved, there is usually a safety latch on the oven door to lock out the self cleaning mode.</p></li> <li><p>Use oven cleaning spray.  <a href="http://www.easyoff.us/" rel="nofollow">Easy-Off</a> is the most popular example of this.  You spray it on, wait a few hours, and then wipe it out with a damp sponge (follow the instructions).  All of the crud in your oven will turn into a brown sludge that just wipes away.  Be warned, oven cleaners are extremely caustic.  Use rubber gloves, and don't rub your eyes while you are working.  The fumes are nasty too.  They have newer low-odor ones, but they can still make you gag.</p></li> </ol>  <p>Option #3 will make your oven look shiny and clean.  However, it takes a lot of manual labor to get it looking good.  Might take more than one cleaning session.</p>
894		<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.mistecology.com/" rel="nofollow">somebody makes a product that does exactly that</a>.</p>  <p>Seems the problem with spraying water directly into the unit is increased corrosion as you mention.  To get around that, it looks like their product actually uses a kind of "wet bag" that surrounds the unit and cools the air as it is sucked through the bag.</p>
895	How much cooling can I expect from a central air conditioner?	<p>Yesterday's high was 106.0F, low of 79.2F, full sun all day.  AC set at 78F, indoor temperature reached about 85F. Today's high was 105.4F, low of 81.1F, full sun all day, now about 102 at 7pm.  AC set at 78F all day, temperature climbed steadily through the day, and is now 89F.</p>  <p>Is it reasonable to expect an AC unit to maintain 78F in this weather?</p>
896	Best review sites/web resources for finding a contractor?	<p>Many times we need to hire a contractor and try to extensively google for reviews on that contractor. Sometimes to no avail :(</p>  <p>Just curious what web resources you use when trying to find a contractor? Be it a review site or some other method, what have you used in the past to identify the best person for the job?</p>
897		<p>I have used <a href="http://www.servicemagic.com/" rel="nofollow">ServiceMagic</a> (http://www.servicemagic.com/) in the past and been pretty happy with the results (I was able to find a good electrician through it), but that was along with checking up on the contractor through a Google search.  I wouldn't just trust a ServiceMagic reference without being able to find some other proof of the quality of the contractor.  I do not have a specific list but usually if the contractor has a quality website, business license, 800 phone number, etc. then they get some points toward being awarded my business.</p>
898		<p>A properly functioning and properly sized central air conditioning unit should be able to maintain the temperature of your house at any reasonable temperature you select.  The amount of cooling available is related to the size of the system, insulation in the house, and finally outside air temperature.</p>  <p>From your description I would guess either you don't have a big enough compressor, or you don't have enough airflow through the house.  It's also possible the cooling element in the system has become dirty and no longer transfers enough heat from the air into the element.</p>
899		<p>The first thing to check is the return air filters. If they're dirty, your system won't be able to keep up. Also, if the coils are dirty or the refrigerant is low, you will not get efficient cooling. </p>  <p>You can clean your condenser coils (the outside unit) yourself using a jet of water from a hose. Contact a service company to clean your evaporator coils, do a system check, replace refrigerant and do repairs.</p>  <p>The amount of in and out traffic you have, shade trees, insulation, type of windows, etc., all play a part in how well your system works.</p>  <p>It's been about 100 degrees F here the last couple of days and the thermostat is set at 78 and has had no problem maintaining that.</p>
900		<p>I have the same filter location as referenced by Steve Armstrong.  There is no slot for the filter but it is just held in place over the return duct by a metal arm.</p>  <p>Here is the opening between the return and the blower: <img src="http://serverintellect.jeffwids.com/public/20100802_762_furnace_filter.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>And here is the filter in place over that opening with the metal arm holding it in place: <img src="http://serverintellect.jeffwids.com/public/20100802_762_furnace_filter_2.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>  <p>I would not have known a filter was supposed to go there if there hadn't been one there already.</p>

902		<p>If your basement is really dry as you suggest, carpeting directly on top is fine.</p>  <p>To test: Take a 1x1m sheet of plastic (garbage bag would do) and tape it to the floor making sure it's sealed all the way around. Leave it there for 24h at least and see if moisture appears at the bottom.</p>  <p>If it's bone dry, you should be OK. We renovated our basement and based on the carpet installer's recommendation, went with a really good quality under-pad with berber carpet on top.</p>  <p>You would never say that it was on concrete. The carpet is great under your feet and not cold at all.</p>  <p>I believe the biggest factor is moisture. If it's not a dry basement, I would probably put a sub-floor in. I don't know if a moisture barrier is actually "good" as it could actually trap moisture under there that would accumulate over time. DryCore (subfloor) for example has channels underneath that eventually vent out on the sides. All concrete will release some moisture over time and I suspect a "breathing" carpet is probably better then something with plastic barrier with a 100% seal.</p>
903		<p>As others have said, <strong>if</strong> the unit is properly sized for the house, <strong>and</strong> the insulation is good enough to keep the heat out, <strong>and</strong> there is enough airflow in the house, the A/C should be able to handle almost any temperature you set it to.</p>  <p>There is a point where it gets so hot outside that air conditioners simply can't do anything to get rid of the heat (the outdoor coil temp equals the outdoor air temp).  This is extreme though, >110 deg F.  You're getting pretty hot, but shouldn't be at that point yet.  (Most A/C units will have specs on this.  You can try looking up some specs for it online.)</p>  <p>You indicated the system is turning on and off, so I don't think it's your thermostat.</p>  <p>How cold is the air coming out of your vents?  If the system is working properly, it should be as cold as your fridge.  If it isn't cold (not cool, cold), you have a problem.</p>  <p>Look at the lines on the outdoor unit.  Are they frosting up at all?  Is there excessive dripping from your indoor air handler?  If your lines are freezing up, turn the system off and call a service company.  That means you are probably low on coolant, and running the system without will burn up the compressor.</p>  <p>Other problems that would prevent cold air would be crud on the coil, or the fan on the outdoor unit not working properly.</p>  <p>If the airflow is weak, then you have an airflow problem.  Check the air filters in the system.  Make sure your ducts aren't plugged somehow.  Check for closed dampers or closed vents.  Make sure a duct didn't pop loose somewhere (blowing air into the attic instead of out the vents).  Make sure your air handler is blowing air.</p>
904		<p>Based on the comments, I think you are talking about the condensation line from the air handler.</p>  <p>For the condensate, you shouldn't need to worry about bacteria.  It's not like you are drinking from it, and it doesn't form a pool of stagnant water in your system (unless it is plugged).</p>  <p>You <strong>do</strong> need to worry if the condensation line gets plugged up, however.  If so, it will back up and flood your basement/attic (wherever the air handler is installed).  On a humid day, the system can extract quite a bit of water from the air.  You don't want that on your basement floor.</p>  <p>The water that drips through the lines is condensation, and therefore very clean.  The water won't have any crud in it to deposit in the line.  (Unless your air handler is filled with dirty air, then you have bigger problems.)</p>  <p>Depending on where the other end of the condensation line leads, this might be a more likely entry point for dirt/scum.  If it is outside near the ground, mud could splash into it, bugs could crawl into it, etc.</p>  <p>Probably the easiest thing to do would be to attach a Shop Vac to the far end of the line and let it suck.  You could also use an air compressor to blow out the line from the inside.</p>  <p>Another option would be to pour some diluted drain cleaner (Draino) into the line, and then flush it out with the hose.  Make sure you flush it throughly.  You don't want the cleaner to sit in there and eat the pipe.</p>  <p>Cleaning the condensate line shouldn't need to be done often.  Once a year at most.  Most people probably never clean theirs.</p>
905		<p>It only really needs to be cleaned if it becomes blocked or restricted, if you notice a build up of algae or other such grossness you can flush the line with a 16/1 water bleach mix (making sure you clear the blockage first).  After the water bleach mix I would flush the line again with straight water a day or two later, just to make sure the bleach and whatever it cleans is cleared out.</p>  <p>As for how often.  It really depends on your situation, keep an eye on it and if it starts to build up flush it again before it becomes blocked.  If you find yourself cleaning it often (more than once a year), you may want to do some investigation to find the underlying cause.</p>
906	What "code" applies to projects that I do in my own home?	<p>A good portion of the answers and discussion on this site references "code". </p>  <p>What does a DIY-er need to know about code as it relates to <strong>project in their own home</strong>? Most of what I can find online either refers to commercial projects or third-party projects.</p>  <p>Also, which code applies? For example, I live in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the USA. It would seem that there are at least 3 levels of code that might apply:</p>  <ul> <li><a href="http://library1.municode.com/default-test/template.htm?view=browse&amp;doc_action=setdoc&amp;doc_keytype=tocid&amp;doc_key=934c00d5bfc99a657f43565dc201f023&amp;infobase=10051">Fairfax County Home Improvement Code</a></li> <li><a href="https://www2.iccsafe.org/states/Virginia/Residential/Res-Frameset.html">State of Virginia Residential Code</a></li> <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Building_Code">International Residential Code</a></li> </ul>
907		<p>You need to contact your local building department.  In the U.S., most of the residential building regulations exist at the state level, but in many states the codes can be amended by counties and even individual towns.</p>  <p>The International Residential Code and its competitors are "model codes."  States often adopt model codes (with local modifications) to avoid the cost and hassle of writing their own codes from scratch, and also because it is beneficial for codes to be harmonized so that the same building materials can be used in different locations.</p>
908		<p>I tend to pour a cup of bleach down the line once a month. Without that at least in Florida you WILL get an algae backup in the line, which if you have bad overflow sensor can cause all kinds of fun water problems.</p>  <p>If it is already blocked, just pour the bleach and let it sit. Eventually enough algae will die and the block will clear itself out.</p>
909		<p>Vebjorn explains it pretty well.  Codes are generally set at a local level (state, county, or city) but localities don't usually write their own codes, they usually just adopt a particular year version of a national code (e.g. the <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/catalog/product.asp?pid=7011SB&amp;order_src=A534&amp;CMP=KNC-A534&amp;HBX_PK=electric+code&amp;HBX_OU=50&amp;gclid=CKTKlfK1naMCFRsNswodbWUjrA&amp;cookie_test=1" rel="nofollow">National Electric Code</a>).  They make their own ammends to those codes as well though.</p>  <p>Technically everybody is subject to whatever codes are adopted by their locality, but in reality homeowners can get away with pretty much anything they want on their own home.  Of course following the codes is recommended for safety reasons and to prevent issues that may come up during an inspection at resale.</p>  <p>As an interesting legal side-note to this, many of the national codes are actually copyrighted works.  Because of this, you actually have to pay to buy a copy of the law in order to know what the law is.  I believe that this technically violates the constitution as laws cannot be copyrighted, but most localities skirt that by having a copy of the code book on hand that you can stop by and read.</p>
910		<p>I've used the <a href="http://austin.craigslist.org/" rel="nofollow">Craig's List</a> services section, but without much luck. I don't know if it my breath or something, but even people posting ads that seem desperate for work never return my messages.</p>
911	Sealing pressure treated deck, to be stained later on	<p>I have just finished building a deck from pressure treated lumber. We've put the deck to use immediately and having all our meals on it. I'm worried about greasy food morsels staining the deck.</p>  <p>My plan is to let the wood dry/age for 2-3 years before staining it. I've read that it is recommended to wait a bit for the wood to dry and change color before staining. I've also seen that there are detergents that can remove oil stains before the actual staining. But, is there anything I can do in the meantime to protect the wood from food stains? If I seal with a water/oil repellent seal, won't that prevent the actual stain from penetrating the wood properly?</p>

913	Can I fit an extractor fan in a window?	<p>We have a basement flat and we suspect that the bathroom exhaust fans do not go anywhere, which causes a fair bit of damp in the flat which manifests itself as condensation on the windows in the winter.</p>  <p>I'd like to fit an extractor fan, or at least some sort of vent to allow the air to circulate (this should help with the condensation shouldn't it?), but don't want to drill through the wall as there is a damp proof membrane in there.  Can I fit something into the window, and how do I go about cutting a hole in the glass to accommodate it?  I've seen those cat-flaps that are in the windows so I assume it must be able to be done...  </p>
914		<p>Here are some reasons that you should follow the applicable codes, even if you could "get away with" not following them:</p>  <ul> <li><p>Safety: Codes are written for a reason.  They address real problems, and ignoring them can cause real issues.</p></li> <li><p>Liability: If someone visiting you property gets hurt because you didn't follow the codes, there is a big liability issue there, possibly even criminal liability if gross negligence can be proven.</p></li> <li><p>Resale: If work is not done to code, you may not be able to resell the property.</p></li> <li><p>Future work: If you have unrelated work do in the future, you may not be able to get the work approved if other parts are not up to code.  </p></li> </ul>  <p>On a related not, work is supposed to conform to the code at the time that it was done.  If the code changes in the future, you do not have to redo anything.  However, if major remodeling is done you may have to bring everything up to the current code.</p>
915		<p>I would be concerned that sealing the deck now might create a major problem when it comes time to stain it -- I'm thinking big blotches of different shades caused by differing amounts of stain absorption as a result of the sealing.  Whereas greasy food morsels will at worst be a minor problem that will likely be completely solved by the good cleaning you're going to give the deck before staining anyway.</p>
916		<p>Does the window open? Or is it a fixed pane? If it opens (or if you can find one the same size that opens) you could install a window exhaust fan like <a href="http://www.air-n-water.com/product/hawf2021.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a> that mounts in the window frame. That way you don't have to mess with cutting a hole in the glass.</p>  <p>Another option would bet to place a dehumidifier in the bathroom.</p>
917		<p>I disagree with @Mike - I don't think sealing it will have much effect on the stain.  Two reasons:</p>  <ol> <li>Deck stains are typically (I'm tempted to say always) pigment stains rather than dye stains.  Those deposit pigment on the surface of the wood and penetration is minimal.  A sealant shouldn't interfere with that.</li> <li>A sealant will typically be a penetrating sealant not a film sealant, so it shouldn't interfere at all with the adherence of the later stain.</li> </ol>  <p>That said, I'm not sure you'll see much benefit from the sealant.  Penetrating sealants will certainly give you a bit more time to clean up a spill but they won't prevent a stain: that's why tabletops are usually finished with a film finish, and if they're not, you use coasters and place mats.  You wouldn't want to use a film finish to a deck because it will certainly peel in short order as the wood expands and contracts under rain and sunshine.</p>  <p>I wouldn't bother. If food gets spilled and you're worried, scrub right away with soap and water.  I'll wager you won't notice any minor food marks after the stain has been applied.</p>
918	Is there a case where nails are better than screws, from an engineering/structural standpoint?	<p>Is there a case where nails are better than screws, from a structural standpoint?</p>  <p>For instance: Say you used screws instead of nails on a backyard deck, when the design specifically called for nails. Would the result be inferior? Could it fail inspection? Would nails absolutely be preferable in this instance?</p>  <p>Assume the screws are at least as thick/long as the intended nails. Are there any rules of thumb about when to use screws vs. nails?</p>
920		<p>In Washington State (and most, if not all other states)</p>  <p>Any homeowner with the proper permit(s) can perform work on their home - but the work is required to be done to the applicable code, inspected and signed off, just like a professional contractor.  Just because you're DIY doesn't mean you get a break from being code compliant.</p>  <p>So when you pull a permit, the work you do is required to be compliant to the spec at the time.  e.g. electrical work permitted today is generally bound to the 2008 National Electric Code (aka NFPA 70).  Work I did on my house in 1999 is compliant to the 1999 NEC, but if my permit says I went and made alterations to that work done 10+ years ago, I would still have to make any upgrades to meet the 2008 spec.</p>  <p>The difficult part is knowing what or who is the governing authority or specification regarding the work you're doing.  Calling your county/city building inspector should get you the right answers when there are situations where different code bodies offer ambiguous or conflicting information. </p>  <p>Also just visiting the website for your city/county code enforcement office (mine does this) will have guidance on what work requires permitting and what doesn't require a permit.</p>
921		<p>Using a water cooled condensing units for refrigeration is not a new idea - large chiller units have been doing this for many years, but it's not as simple as hooking up a hose and letting er rip...  there's a lot of additional maintenance involved with all the cooling water infrastructure - even a simple spray evaporation cooling system requires nozzle cleanings, pump maintenance and such pretty regularly.</p>  <p>Home AC units don't really need the efficiency boost from evaporative cooling because the air cooled condensing unit(s) are efficient enough without introducing the complexities of water lines, spray bars and a drainage system for a small direct expansion system.  If the condenser is not giving you the proper heat rejection - just upsize the heat exchanger... far cheaper and more reliable right?</p>  <p>That being said, I have a window unit AC that takes the condensate and splashes it back on the condenser fins to boost efficiency, and I know there is a model of RV air conditioner which does the same thing.  It is possible this feature has been added to DX condensing units - but I have been out of the HVAC world for some years now.   </p>
922		<p>Not a website, but the best way I've found to find contractors is to talk to them at other job sites.  If you know where any new houses are being built near-by, run over and talk to the contractors on site.  They can show you their work and recommend others that they work with too.</p>

924		<p>Technically when using joist hangers, a specific kind of hardened galvanized nails are supposed to be used.  This is because regular deck screws probably don't have the necessary shear strength.  For a deck though, I've used screws before without any problem. Although if you were planning to put a lot of weight on the deck (say, a hot tub) I would be a bit more concerned about that.</p>  <p>Aside from that, I can't think of any other places where screws would be a problem.</p>
925		<p>Screws would tend to be slightly thicker than nails (because of the threads) so you would probably want to watch out for splitting of the wood and might want to require drilling pilot holes if you switch to screws.  For the most part though, screws would work better than nails in the long term (would not pop up over time) but would be harder to use (pilot holes, snapping, etc.) during the installation for your backyard deck.</p>  <p>BUT if you have some sort of project that is supplying the nails/hardware then I would be cautious about swapping out one sort of hardware for another.  The pre-supplied product could have been specially chosen for the job and so you would not want to go and swap it out because you <em>think</em> it is better to have screws.  One such example would be some wooden playsets where all of the hardware is supplied... make sure you use what they give you (and what the engineers said will work).</p>
926		<p>Without a picture of your fireplace, I couldn't tell for sure, but I would look in to fire brick. It is a near perfect insulator since it is a light brick with lots of air bubbles (air insulates).</p>  <p>Check here:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=fire+brick&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=8n1YTJmlCd6Knwf7hZS2BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQrQQwAA" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/products?q=fire+brick&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=8n1YTJmlCd6Knwf7hZS2BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQrQQwAA</a></p>  <p>..or at a local fireplace store.</p>
927		<p>Aside from the kitchen, I would say the bathroom is one of the most likely places for things to catch fire.  You have:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Water and electricity (never a great combination).</p></li> <li><p>Curling irons and hair dryers (often cheaply made &amp; get very hot)</p></li> <li><p>Lots of flammable things (paint, wallpaper, drywall, cabinets, towels, etc.)</p></li> <li><p>Things that go boom (hair spray, air fresheners, other aerosols)</p></li> </ol>
928	Is toenailing necessary for a joist-to-ledger attachment?	<p>Is it sufficient to rest joists on joist hangers or should you always toenail (drive screws/nails at an angle through the joist). And does the toenail have to drive into the ledger or just hold the joist on the joist hanger?</p>
929		<p>Screws are a "superior" fastener over a nail (they have far superior tensile strength) - especially if you're talking about screwing down decking.</p>  <p>However there are many scenarios where a nail is the proper fastener for the application (attaching joists is one example - screws are brittle and will fail when subjected to the forces of a shear loaded application)</p>  <p>Using your deck example - you should use nails to attach the joists to the deck framing but use screws to fasten down the decking itself.</p>  <p>Also keep in mind that screws take a longer time to install - think of a nail gun versus a drill...</p>
930		<p>I would always use at least one toenail to prevent the joist from shifting around on you (either while you are working or later due to warping)  It's better to run the toenail into the ledger, but just attaching it to the joist hanger is fine too.  Face nailing through the ledger into the joist works fine as well.</p>
931		<p>Always toenail . . . just resting it on the joist hanger means it could slip out. Some joist hangers have a place for you to nail though the hanger, into the joist, and then finally into the ledger.</p>
932		<p>I lived in a condo built in the early 50's with a super cool looking chrome bathroom exhaust fan.  The original motor finally died after 54 years of service... so I went looking for a replacement fan/light unit.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I was unsuccessful as well since the original fan housing is not the "standard" (read: newer) bathroom exhaust fan size.</p>  <p>Anyway, I was able to find a replacement motor for the exhaust fan assembly and it worked beautifully.  If the motor has any nameplate data on it - odds are you can probably find an equivalent replacement.</p>  <p>I bought mine from this place <a href="http://www.electricmotorwarehouse.com/aosmith/nutone/nutone.htm">Replacement Bath Vent Fan Motors</a> - just remember it doesn't necessarily have to say "bath vent fan motor" in order to work, so long as the motor nameplate data (volts, amps, HP) are similar.</p>  <p>Good luck!</p>

934		<p>Online is generally the best way to procure parts, but sometimes going to the supply house is necessary to be sure you're getting the proper part(s), or you're under a time constraint.  Plus they have all kinds of neat stuff inside those places - I always end up picking up extra items when I'm at Grainger, et al. </p>  <p>I used to work for a large industrial controls manufacturer, I could walk into just about any industrial supply house, use the account set up for that business and just pay cash.  That worked for years, even after I left that place of employment.  Unfortunately I moved to a distant city, so that plan is now kaput.</p>  <p>On the flip side you can use your own business, (or create your own "business" - business licenses aren't very expensive) and sign up for commercial accounts wherever you need.  The counter people at those supply houses don't care if you work for One Dude Software Corporation or General Electric - only if your business info is in their database!</p>
935		<p>Sure you can - just depends on how you want to attack the problem.</p>  <p>You could either replace the window sash with a mount for the fan (removing the window itself - minus the frame and replacing it with finish grade plywood), or build a frame over the rear of the window and hang a fan from it.  That way you don't actually need to cut the glass.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-plans/shop-organization/basement-window-exhaust-fan/" rel="nofollow">Here's one example</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.taylorrental.com/tip_detail.asp?id=59" rel="nofollow">Here's another</a></p>
936		<p>See this <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/asktoh/question/0,,1141241,00.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>.  For a quick temporary fix you can use a repair sleeve, or clamp.</p>
937		<p>You should always nail your joists to the joist hangers, using the type and quantity of nails recommended by the hanger manufacturer for the type of hangers you're using.  Double-shear hangers, the most common type, will have special nail holes designed to direct the joist nails at an angle through the joist and into the ledger or header.  Typically you'll use 16d or 10d standard-length nails for the joists, and short 1-1/2" 10d nail for fastening the hanger to the ledger or header.  Here's an image from <a href="http://www.strongtie.com/products/connectors/LUS-HUS.asp">Simpson's website</a> of a properly installed double-shear joist hanger:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.strongtie.com/graphics/products/large/061f-2009.gif" alt="alt text"></p>
938		<p>CO is dangerous as it has not odor, It is best not to take risks.</p>  <p>You can place a gas water heater outside in a metal closet with the proper ventilation.</p>  <p>This is much safer. I also currently have an electric heater, but when I put in gas pipes a couple of years ago, I put one outside so one day I can set up a gas heater in a safe way.</p>
940		<p>Although both ways are advised by different sources, I have built dozens of decks in Maine as a contractor and have found that pressure treated and cedar boards almost always crown to the bark side and recommend the bark side face outward.  Obviously this helps shed water and doesn't collect ice in pockets in the winter. Don't mix the methods as this can result in a very unattractive surface after a couple of years. Always be sure to use treaded fasteners, never galvanized common nails and be sure to sink coated screws or stainless steel ring shank nails. make them  flush or slightly below the wood surface to eliminate tripping hazards or use under deck clip systems. If you find some boards that have a bad finish on the side you want to expose, don't use them!  Bring them back and have them replaced. This may sound like a pain, but flawed wood with checks or cracks will degrade very quickly and ruin all the hard work you have done on that expensive deck. Don't forget to water isolate the ledger from the building and resist the temptation to use cheap waterproofing products. Often the details of construction in areas you can't see is as if not more important than the viewed surfaces. Good luck. </p>
941	Geothermal Resources	<p>I am very interested in learning more about Geothermal solutions for my house.  </p>  <p>What are the best resources for learning about and planning a Geothermal systems for a residential house?</p>  <p>Also, does anyone know any resources for DIY Geothermal solutions?  I was kind of hoping to start by tinkering with a smaller scale system to maybe use along with my current HVAC system.</p>
942		<p>Talk to some local installers first.</p>  <p>Unless you have a background in HVAC, I would say installing a geo is NOT a viable DIY project.</p>
943	How much weight can screws in drywall withstand?	<p>I've always had the question of how much weight can a single screw into a drywall withstand?</p>  <p>For instance, I would like to do things like this:</p>  <p><img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/2j65sf7.jpg" alt="Hanging piece of furniture"></p>  <p>It's hanged with 5 screws. The whole thing weights approximately 50kg (110 pounds) so we can say that each screw stands approximately 10kg (22 pounds).</p>  <p>The person who installed it said it was fine, but is it really?</p>  <p>Do somebody know a study or some numbers regarding how much weight this material can stand?</p>  <p>EDIT: Just to clarify, it's not screwed to studs. It's screwed to the drywall.</p>
944		<p>You can do things like this without relying on drywall only to support it.  Find studs in the wall (buy a studfinder) and screw into them.</p>  <p>While I don't know exactly how much one can hang on a screw in the drywall, I wouldn't hang anything on it.  Drywall is an extremely brittle material.  This means that even if something hangs on it just fine, a small shock (for example of a closing door) can spread cracks from around the tension points (screws).  This means that with time the shelf will either drift down under its own weight, or most likely will fall off.  In short: don't do it.  I wouldn't hang a toilet paper holder just on the drywall.</p>
945		<p>For hanging something that wide, you'll have at least a few studs behind it to anchor to. So it's not a matter of how much weight the drywall can hold. Anything heavy like a floating entertainment center should definitely be screwed into studs. I'd have to disagree with Rom though that a toilet paper holder needs a stud. Something light like that should be fine as long as you use drywall anchors rather than regular screws.</p>
946		<p>I doubt there are filters on the individual returns, just at the main air handler return.  I change filters every month (if I remember) because we live in the country and have dogs and cats.  Sometimes there's a small drift of hair at the main return in the great room, which is a sign we need to sweep and reminds me to change the AC/furnace filter.</p>  <p>What happens if you don't change your filter often enough is the fan motor burns out much sooner than it should, which will cost a 4 digit number to replace.  Last time I replaced the whole furnace/air handler because it only cost $200 more than the fan motor parts.</p>
947		<p>There are several kinds of drywall anchors and they each have their own weight rating. Some work by drilling a small hole and tapping in a plastic sleeve and others work by drilling a bigger hole and screwing a plastic sleeve and there are others where you drill a hole and the metal butterfly expands behind the drywall know as molly bolts (thanks comments!). Recently I saw anchors where you drill a 1 inch hole in the drywall and this big contraption grips the inside of the drywall (wish I could remember the name).  Anyway, each of the big drywall anchors could hold over 50 pounds!</p>  <p>The positive response got me to go dig for those contraptions. Turns out they are made by Moen and they're called <a href="http://www.moen.com/securemount">SecureMount</a>. I have the Moen SMA3000 and they really are just a bigger version of toggle bolts (spring loaded metal wings that fold and have a long machine screw).</p>  <p>I also found this <a href="http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/inffastener/infanchor/infanchor.html">useful link</a> that has pictures and describes all the types mentioned (except the SecureMount of course . . . those are new and very much a niche product).</p>
948		<p>It's always better to attach it to studs - which should certainly be possible with something that big.  That said though, you might be <a href="http://www.dannylipford.com/diy-home-improvement/design-and-decor/testing-wall-anchors-and-picture-hangers/">surprised how much a drywall anchor can hold</a>.</p>  <p>How well they work depends on the load though.  They will work best with a static downward load - a fixed weight close to the wall pulling directly downward. </p>  <p>They will work much worse with loads that pull down and outward (like a shelf) or dynamic loads where the weight changes regularly causing the fastener to loosen up.  Something like a toilet paper holder represents the worst of both worlds - it sticks out from the wall with the weight at the end, and you produce a dynamic load on it whenever you pull on the TP roll.</p>
949	What is the recommended home design software?	<p>I am going to be finishing my basement.  I would like to design the new basement myself using design software.  What is the recommended home design software?</p>
950		<p>I'd start with the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pump" rel="nofollow">Geothermal Heat Pumps</a> which is pretty good at giving the overview. </p>  <p>It's a bit hard to do a 'small scale' system which you might expand later if you are laying pipe in the ground or in a pond. You probably don't want to do that twice. But an open system might give you a chance to play with the ideas. If you search around online there are a lot of DIY projects that can allow you to experiment with geothermal. Despite the the comments of others, it's not rocket surgery ;) You could build a small heat exchanger or put in a small open loop system in front of your existing HVAC and let the open loop geo system do most of the work and have the existing system only kick in if the temp gets out of bounds. </p>  <p>What IS hard is DIY a system that will be efficient and save you money. Experimenting and understanding how geotherm works is a great project where you can learn a lot. But it's hard to beat the efficiency of commercial systems. </p>  <p>It is a good idea to talk with local installers, but be careful of which ones you talk to. If they are not specialists in geothermal they may not have good info. Make sure they have experience designing and installing and then get info appropriate for your geography. </p>

952	Suggestions for treehouse platform support without posts	<p>I'm building a treehouse in a fully grown 50 foot tree that has four trunks (as it were) each of which is between a half foot to a foot in diameter.  First, is this a good candidate for a small tree house (5x5 platform) that will be attached directly to the tree?  If so, does anyone have any recommendations for supports in a configuration like that.  I have some ideas but I wanted to get the opinions of people who have experience in contracting and even treehouse building.</p>
953		<p><a href="http://www.thetreehouseguide.com/building.htm">The Treehouse Guide</a> is a pretty comprehensive resource. It covers topics from picking out the tree to building code adherence.</p>
954		<p>There are powered gable vents you can install (cut a hole thru the side of the attic, or use the already provided gable vent) and they're fairly inexpensive.  The best way to remove heat would be to use those small windows for makeup air and use a separate powered vent to exhaust the hot air.   </p>  <p>The previous poster has a good suggestion about setting up a PV panel to run the fan, but in order to get sufficient airflow through the attic you'll probably need a pretty large sized PV setup which can get prohibitively expensive.  I've been researching them for my motorhome - the rough thumb rule seems to be ~1000 dollars per 100 watts of solar power (I added in costs for batteries and inverter since your home doesn't already come equipped)  </p>  <p>Even a smallish AC powered gable vent fan is going to pull 400 watts - so you can see how this gets expensive.  There is a combination solar panel/attic vent kits which uses a DC motor but I'm not sure about the effectiveness. It seems to be rated fairly low in terms of air volume moved (800 CFM vs 1200-1600 for a 110v powered vent fan).</p>  <p>Exhausting your attic will definitely save you energy as you're removing a huge heatload from your air conditioning - the superheated air in your attic.</p>
955		<p>In the UK, "code" is the Buildings Regulations, available from <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>  <p>In practice there's different levels of assessment required roughly corresponding to risk. For instance, work on gas installations and some electrical work must be performed by a qualified engineer. Similarly, while anyone can do structural work it needs to be inspected afterwards by the Building Control Officer of the local council. </p>  <p>These regulations have teeth: not only legally, but it can be difficult or impossible to sell a house that has structural defects to anyone that needs a mortgage. (I had to have an installation of an RSJ inspected thirty years after installation by a previous owner when I sold a flat in Brighton.)</p>  <p>Different more strict regulations apply to properties that are "listed" (i.e. considered of regional or national historic importance) or in a conservation district. Grade 1 listed buildings need to have permission granted by the council if you want to paint an interior wall, for example. </p>  <p>See also the question on buildings regs versus planning permission, <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/218/what-is-the-difference-between-planning-permission-and-building-regulation-in">here</a>.</p>
956		<p>Ideally you need a 2 zone HVAC system for your house if you're trying to maintain an upstairs/downstairs sort of temperature control scheme.  This is definitely a good idea in terms of energy savings; you don't want to fully heat or cool those areas which aren't occupied.</p>  <p>Several questions come up:</p>  <ol> <li>Is there a fixed occupancy schedule for both areas?  </li> <li>What is your primary concern - energy savings or comfort?</li> </ol>  <p>Without a sophisticated HVAC controls system in place you're basically going to be tied to a time based control scheme, so you need to figure out when you're going to be upstairs vs downstairs and home/not home so you can modify your thermostat settings accordingly.</p>  <p>Just as a rough guide - when setting up an office building we would tend to run the daytime temperature between 70-74 degrees and set back to 60-62 in heating season or 80-82 in the cooling season when the space was not occupied (night).  Letting the building get any colder (or hotter) only made for excessively long AC or heating runs to get the space(s) up to temp.</p>  <p>Even an unoccupied/unimproved tenant space is kept between 60-80 degrees to minimize the impact on overall building heating/cooling. </p>
958	Where can I find a garage door (slot) mail basket?	<p>I'm looking for a place I can buy a garage door mail slot basket. I had one in my old (rented) house and I'm looking to install one. It should look something like the image below, and keep upright when the garage door is opening.<br> <a href="http://www.brighthardware.com/mailcatcher_eb2bl_web.html" rel="nofollow">This site</a> was selling them, but as you can see on the top of their page, not anymore :(<br> If you have a suggestion where I can buy the basket itself (need to have round edge to act as a hinge when the door opens) and assemble it myself, that would be a good start too.</p>  <p><img src="http://www.brighthardware.com/images/basket_fwd_s.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>
959	What's the best way to install a pet door in an exterior wall?	<p>I want to install a pet door to allow my dog to let herself out. The door would run out onto a deck attached to the back of the house. On the wall connected to the deck, I have a sliding glass door and enough wall space that the pet door could be located in a bunch of different situations. So the question is, what would be the preferred location/installing method?</p>  <ul> <li>In the sliding glass door itself? (Seems difficult if not impossible)</li> <li>In the wall next to the door, between studs? (Cutting through drywall, insulation, and the exterior wall/siding)</li> <li>In the wall centered on a stud? (Not sure how much this would differ from option 2)</li> </ul>  <p>Once the hole is made, would you frame around it? Do they sell pet door designed for exactly this (vs placing in an existing metal or wood door)?</p>
960		<p>This <a href="http://toddkeeblersthisnewhouse.blogspot.com/2008/02/netflix-should-thank-me.html" rel="nofollow">guy</a> crafted his own.</p>  <p>This site sells <a href="http://houseofantiquehardware.com/s.nl/sc.10/category.48/.f" rel="nofollow">mail baskets</a>.</p>  <p>You could always use a priority mail box and attach it with a few bolts and screws. Hot glue a dowel rod to the box and use the same type of clips to get the hanging effect. </p>
961		<p>My in-laws have a sliding glass door pet door. The door fits inside the track of the door. It works well for them. Perhaps you should check it out: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000633RX8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/PetSafe-Deluxe-Panels-Sliding-Medium/dp/B000633RX8</a></p>  <p>It matches the height of the sliding glass door. The model they have has clear glass so you don't lose visibility. Other models may be completely plastic on the inside with an aluminum frame.</p>  <p>It can be removed because it has a spring catch at the top which you use to fit it to the door. Imagine it cupping the upper track and you can slide it up/down with your hand. This is the least intrusive solution I think.</p>  <p>Once installed, the sliding glass door butts up against the pet door insert so the dogs only go through the pet door. You can add strip insulation where the sliding glass door and pet door meet to reduce air from escaping.</p>
962		<p>Looks like they do sell <a href="http://www.moorepet-petdoors.com/Wall-Mounted-Pet-Doors-s/21.htm&amp;Click=1016?gclid=CLqR2ODZoKMCFRgbswodDTYFpw" rel="nofollow">pet doors</a> for that purpose. You can even pick the size.</p>  <p>As far as installing it, I think the last thing you want to do is center it on a stud.</p>
963		<p>My advice: make friends with an HVAC guy.</p>  <p>Just about any tinbender I knew would do a cash job on a Saturday for cheap :)</p>
964		<p>Going on the advice of a friend who used to teach carpentry, we painted the boards with a light coat of oil before building the forms. When we knocked the forms apart there was little concrete stuck on, perhaps 10% coverage. I let the boards sit and dry out completey then wacked them with a hammer, taking care of another %5 or so. After that a belt sander with coarse grit paper removed the remainder of the concrete and oil stains. </p>  <p>The final result is boards that while not good as new are suitable for most applications (might not be paintable) and safe for power tools. We're using them for our deck joists.</p>
965	Is it a good idea to use a Fernco repair fitting within a finished wall cavity?	<p>I have an unfinished basement, and I installed a redirector for my sump pump output so it can be drained to the sanitary sewer during winter months (and yes, I'm paying for the right to do so, and I'm following the rules :)).  I installed a wye in the vertical drain pipe, and I needed a way of reconnecting said pipe after introducing the new fitting.  To do this, I took a section of the 3" pipe, glued it to the top of the wye, and joined it to the original pipe with a Fernco fitting (specifically, <a href="http://www.buyplumbing.net/index.html?pg=pd&amp;_i=105633" rel="nofollow">this guy</a>).</p>  <p>The question: is it safe to leave the Fernco fitting in place and enclose it in a wall when I go to finish the basement?</p>
966		<p>Working to code and working under a permit do not have to be related.  I always advocate doing work that meets or exceeds code, but many things in your own home do not require permits.  However, most cities are not going to turn you down if you offer to give them money for their permission to work on your own home.</p>  <p>Home Owners Associations can also have a say in what you can do to your home.</p>  <p>Even if work is done to current code at the time, if code changes you'll usually have to include modifying a building to meet the new current code in any request for a work permit.  There are still lots of buildings out there which need work or repair, but aren't getting them because code has changed.  Accessibility features (ramps, elevators) are a common sticking point in commercial buildings.</p>
967		<p>I would go with an in-wall installation - since you live in Fargo, you're likely to want the extra insulation it can provide.</p>  <p>PetCo carries the <a href="http://www.petco.com/Shop/Product.aspx?sku=1247522&amp;CoreCat=Related_Products" rel="nofollow">Perfect Pet All Weather Series Insulated Pet Door</a> and has a "<a href="http://www.petco.com/product/109272/Perfect-Pet-All-Weather-Series-Door-Wall-Kit.aspx?CoreCat=OnSiteSearch" rel="nofollow">wall kit</a>" that boxes in the area of the hole.</p>  <p><img src="http://s.petco.com/Assets/product_images/0/030559905600C.jpg" alt="picture of pet door"></p>  <p>Something you might have to take consideration of, depending on the wildlife in your area, is that other animals may figure out how to use the door to get <em>in</em> your house. There are <a href="http://www.moorepet.com/Electronic-and-Automatic-Pet-Doors-s/24.htm" rel="nofollow">different types of electronic doors</a> that you can get that have a tag you put on your dog's collar to allow them in and out.</p>  <p>Our door is a more basic version of the PetCo one I linked above, but has a sliding panel on the inside that closes the pet door. Unfortunately, one of our dogs is afraid of the plastic flapper, so he won't use it.</p>
968		<p>I'm not an expert, but it sounds like you have what we have at our house, so I'll say what I know (and/or can reference).</p>  <p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulated_concrete_form" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>: "The forms are interlocking modular units that are dry-stacked (without mortar) and filled with concrete. The forms lock together somewhat like Lego bricks and serve to create a form for the structural walls or floors of a building."</p>  <p>In other words, no wooden studs.  Just plain ol' styrofoam.</p>  <p>If you're able to look at the top part of the wall, you might actually be able to see the protruding Lego brick-like top part of the interlocking structure.  This would also tell you just how thick the form is.</p>  <p>While Wikipedia says the form bricks are dry-stacked, it wouldn't surprise me if there were a little adhesive used between them (it kind of seems like a good idea, but it's possible the form manufacturers recommend against that for some reason).</p>  <p>As far as how they attached the drywall: just a bunch of screws, in our case.  It's also reasonable to use adhesive in addition, as long as it won't eat through the styrofoam (or other material), of course.  The styrofoam was actually surprisingly strong when I was drilling screws into it.  Given that they used somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 screws on the 4' wide floor-to-ceiling sheet of drywall, I have no concerns about it coming down.</p>  <p>There are electrical outlets and phone jacks on our ICF walls, and the lines and boxes are accommodated by carving out appropriate cavities.  That creates another factor to consider when drilling into the ICF wall.  Specifically: how straight are the channels that were carved out, and in which direction were they carved?  Did they use nail plates along the route?</p>  <p>Now, as far as attaching things to the wall <em>securely</em> is concerned... I doubt it would be equivalent to a stud in terms of support capacity, and I'm having trouble finding information on this topic online.  If the drywall is attached directly to the ICF, you won't have any cavity behind the wall to place a spreading-type anchor, so those are ruled out.  Of course, if you make the assumption that the wall is at least as strong as drywall on its own (indeed, I'd assume it's at least a little stronger), you can use a self-drilling drywall anchor (Lowe's has one branded "TOGGLER") and get plenty of capacity.  Plus, you can use them in any location (excluding wire runs, as noted above) without worrying about hitting a stud after you've bored a giant hole in the drywall.</p>
969		<p>There are solar-powered gable fans - an Air Vent-brand fan can be <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_269914-228-NPSG8_?PL=1&amp;productId=3162215&amp;cm_mmc=search_gps-_-gps-_-gps-_-Air%20Vent%20Black%20Gable%20Power%20Ventilation">picked up at Lowe's</a> for just over $200:</p>  <p><img src="http://images.lowes.com/product/converted/046388/046388535604lg.jpg" alt="fan"></p>  <p>The solar panel is on a cord, so it can be installed in the most sunny area while the fan sits in the gable.</p>  <p>From the <a href="http://www.airvent.com/homeowner/products/powerVents-solarGable.shtml">Air Vent website</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The Gable-Mount Solar Vent is an exciting alternative to traditional attic ventilation.

970	Are solar panels cost-effective?	<p>Environmental issues aside, I'd like to know whether solar panels are worth it from a monetary standpoint?</p>  <ul> <li>How long before payoff occurs?</li> <li>Pros &amp; Cons?</li> <li>Is technology moving too fast, e.g. should I wait a year or two?</li> </ul>
971		<p>Payoff depends on the state you live in.  NJ allows you to sell your energy credits to other companies so in NJ it is about a 3-5 year payback (which is great).  Other states have similar programs or offer rebates.  Check out <a href="http://1bog.org/">One Block Off the Grid</a> (http://1bog.org/) if you are interested in solar panels.  They have been great at getting information about the pros and cons and also the benefits on adding solar panels (plus discounts for your entire neighborhood and a local contractor).</p>  <p>Pros:</p>  <ul> <li>It will increase your houses value. </li> <li>Depending on the state you live in you could hit payback very soon (and make a good profit after that). </li> <li>You will just feel good about getting environmentally friendly energy. </li> <li>Your electric bill will be much lower each month (you still draw electricity during the night since batteries are just not worth it yet and most electric companies do not pay you money... your bill could be $0 though each month). </li> </ul>  <p>Cons:</p>  <ul> <li>Your roof should be in good condition before installing the solar panels.</li> <li>Up front cost (some states do not have any incentives). </li> <li>You end up with something on your roof that will not necessarily increase your house's curb appeal.</li> </ul>  <p>Is technology moving too fast, e.g. should I wait a year or two?<br> In my opinion if you live in a state that has good rebates or incentives to get solar panels then I would do it.  I live in NJ and I am <em>so</em> tempted to get solar panels but my hesitation has to do with not being 100% sure I will be in my house in the next 3 to 5 years and also the age of my roof, it is 15 years old and really needs to be replaced first before installing solar panels.</p>
972	Non-Toxic Wood Glue	<p>I've got a cutting board that was left soaking for too long, and it subsequently cracked and split. Is there a non-toxic wood glue I can use to glue it back together? I'm planning on using a quick clamp and whatever type of wood glue is safe to use for food prep surfaces, if there is such a thing.</p>
973		<p>According to <a href="http://www.benchnotes.com/Cutting%20Boards%20folder/cutting_boards.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> regular old TiteBond II is non-toxic and FDA approved for cutting boards.</p>
974	What types of home radon mitigation systems have you used, and how well do they work?	<p>What types of home radon mitigation systems have you used, and how well do they work?  Do recommended types of mitigation systems vary significantly with varying levels of excess radon?  Does climate have any impact on the mitigation system of choice?  Are there any other major factors to consider?</p>
975		<p>I used 3D Home Architect several years ago. It worked well and was inexpensive. As a matter of fact, I got it to design my basement.</p>
976		<p>Always hit studs when you can. If this hit a few studs it will not have a problem at all. Where you have to anchor to drywall, use toggle bolts if heavy, if something like a picture and frame, use a plastic anchor.</p>
977		<p>I would just trim. Then the hinges won't have to be moved. Don't try to trim just one side, but take an even amount off. After cutting, I usually use a belt sander to smooth the edge and knock the edge of the cuts. Tip - If the door is painted nice, or varnished, put some masking take on it for the saw to slide on. </p>
978		<p>I used 3D Home Architect several years ago to design my basement. I bought an older version for less than 20 bucks. It worked well. I would check out their newer version.</p>
979	How can I find a match for ~100 year old door/window trim?	<p>Our house is around 100 years old, and during the course of a bathroom demo, the contractor irreparably broke part of the window trim.</p>  <p>Of course, the big box and local lumber stores are completely useless for finding a match. I imagine the design was common and is probably still available somewhere in bulk. I've also seen an HGTV show where a place used tools that follow the curves of a sample piece to create a match.</p>  <p>The problem is, I don't have a clue where to start my search... any ideas?</p>
980		<p>I use the open source <strong><a href="http://www.qcad.org/" rel="nofollow">QCad</a></strong> software, which is available for several platforms.  I use the Linux version (Ubuntu) but also tested the Mac OSX version which is time limited.</p>  <p>The application is a little bit disappointing if you think in terms of line/shape primitives such as in usual vector based drawing software. Initially I think this kind of software was made for mechanical part design, but many libraries exist for home furniture, electric scheme,...</p>  <p>If:</p>  <ul> <li>you need 2D only </li> <li>you really need precision (a line that is really tangent to a circle, lot of alignment tools, ... )  </li> <li>you want to add dimensions to your design (length, diameters,...) </li> <li>you want to export DXF files (e.g. to send your design to a laser cut machine, yes, amateur can also do that !) </li> <li>you want to produce professional quality drawing</li> </ul>  <p>this soft is definitely an interesting tool for serious amateur.</p>  <p>The leaning curve is slow at the beginning but it definitely worths the effort !</p>
981	How can I straighten pipes behind a wall?	<p>The original builders did a shoddy job when they installed the plumbing in the bathroom, causing the taps/faucets to come out of the tiled plasterboard wall at a slight angle - about 5 degrees - so the flanges aren't flush against the wall. Any ideas on straightning the pipes without breaking the wall; I don't have any spare tiles and am unlikely to find any.</p>
982	What is a smart switch?	<p>I was looking at <a href="http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/385/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-different-types-of-smart-switches-that-are-on-the">this question</a> which mentions smart switches.  What are they?  What are there uses?</p>
983	Any tips on fixing a difficult wall for tiling?	<p>I've got this small old bathroom that I want to lay with ceramic tiles. But to do that the walls should be straight - which they are not. Three of them are almost fine, but the fourth is... well, take a look at the pictures:</p>  <p><img src="http://valts.21.lv/problem/wall.png" alt="Wall"><br> Left: front view at the wall;<br> Right: side view at the wall.</p>  <p>This isn't to scale, but you can see the idea. First of all there is a large towel-dryer in the middle of it, stretching almost all the way across. Secondly, the wall starts slanting away on the upper half.</p>  <p>I cannot remove the towel dryer because the people who designed the original plumbing system (probably dead by now) were... not very smart, to put it politely. It is attached to the central hot water supply in the apartment block and turning off the water means that everyone loses hot water. To make it better, even if I did turn off the water momentarily and remove the dryer, I'd still need to reconnect the open ends or the water flow would be broken (my above neighbour gets the hot water that has passed through my dryer). And last but not least - to turn off the water and do anything with the dryer I have to call the authorities and pay them $30 every time. Royal pain.</p>  <p>So... what would you suggest?</p>
984		<p>Can you cut the wall on the other side of the pipes? That might let you get at them without breaking the tile.</p>  <p>Be aware, however, that if you do, it may not help - if the pipes are at an angle, and you straighten them out, you're going to end up with the pipes wanting to come out at a position slightly to the side of where they are now. In other words, the holes in the wall and tile may no longer be in the right position. You may be able to flex things to make this work, but not necessarily. </p>
985		<p>Am surprised that no one has mentioned Duck Tape (Duct tape?) and 3 in 1 oil.... :)</p>
986		<p>I believe those are switches that can be controlled remotely. The method varies - some can receive commands through power lines, some use radio, some need a separate cable.</p>  <p>You use these when you want to build a "smart house". That is, all the electrical devices can be controlled remotely. For example you could connect to your house from your work through the Internet and turn off the light in the kitchen that you left on. Or you could switch on the coffee maker before departing for home, so that you have fresh coffee when you arrive. Or maybe have your washing machine send you an SMS when the laundry is done. The possibilities are limitless.</p>  <p>The technology isn't anything new, but such devices are still a lot more expensive than traditional electrical networks. They are trying to make it cheaper of course, but it's nowhere near the point where it could be made ubiquitous.</p>  <p>Also they are not problem free. As always - the more stuff there is, the more something can go wrong. And both radio and power-line based communications suffer heavily from noise. Separate cables don't have this issue, but they are difficult to lay out, not to mention expensive. Naturally, progress has been made here as well over the last decades, so the latest types of devices are already quite reliable.</p>  <p>Last but not least - not only are there different methods for communication, but several different protocols as well for each method. So whichever you choose it will severely limit the devices available to you. Of course you could always use the traditional "dumb" devices, but then you'd loose all the benefits of a smart house.</p>
987		<p>Also, depending on your geographical location, you might not get enough sun every year to make it worth. That would be an issue for me for example (though I'm not from US).</p>
988		<p>Look for a local furniture shop or woodworker and ask if they can make it.</p>
989	How can I tell where my inground sprinkler hoses are?	<p>I'm going to be building a deck next week in my backyard! I'm very excited for the project, but I'm concerned about one thing: digging the foundation holes. I have an inground sprinkler system, and I'm concerned that I'm going to hit a buried hose when I'm digging.</p>  <p>How am I supposed to find where the hoses are? Also, what if I start digging and find a hose.. Can I move the hose, or do I have to move the hole?</p>
990		<p>A good, local lumber company should be able to tell you whether such a thing is available.  Even if they don't stock it normally, if it is available, they should be able to special order it for you.</p>
991	Is there a detector of plastic pipe?	<p>I know metal detectors for walls, but in my house there are places where it has a plastic pipe. I wonder if there is a good detector to buy.</p>
993		<p>Typically in the ground they use expensive sensors and ground-penetrating radar to accomplish this. If you can find a stud detector that can detect water in the pipes (you need something to conduct), then you should be in business. </p>  <p>This company makes a <a href="http://www.cscope.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">plastic pipe detector</a>. And so does <a href="http://www.wedetectors.com/MetroTech/Plastic%20Pipe%20Detection/RSP3-4000-50.htm" rel="nofollow">this company</a>. I imagine it uses radar to do it or sound waves.</p>
994		<p>I spent a couple summers in college installing underground sprinkling, so I know a little bit about this.</p>  <p>Typically you will have a large valve box somewhere in your yard.  These will usually have an access hatch (or several small hatches) for maintenance, so they should be easy enough to find.  Typically a pipe will run from the water supply to the valve box.  From the valve box pipes will run out to the various sprinkler heads.  </p>  <p>Each valve in the valve box represents a single zone.  When the sprinklers come on, a valve will open and all the sprinklers in that zone will come on at the same time.  You can tell (roughly) where the pipes will be for that zone by finding the shortest path from the valve box that connects all the sprinklers in a zone.</p>  <p>As long as you dig carefully, you shouldn't have too much trouble.  The pipes are usually pretty tough and are usually buried about a foot or so under the ground.  If you do run into one, you're not going to be able to move it without doing some serious trenching, so you'll most likely be stuck moving your hole instead.</p>
995		<p>I am not sure if there are tools out there for detecting the water in the pipes but I would think they are pretty expensive.</p>  <p>For the most part though the lines will run from one sprinkler head to the next in a straight line (or a gentle curve).  If you run into an irrigation line you can most definitely move it.  Just use an extra piece of pipe and a coupling on either end (plus two hose clamps).  Lowes or Home Depot will have the right sized coupling and hose clamps for your line diameter.  I have broken my sprinkler line twice in my garden (the line runs directly underneath) and patched it both times like this.</p>  <p>Be careful not to pull too hard on the line or you could end up pulling the entire line under the ground and move the attached sprinkler heads.  In other words don't just try and stretch the line around your hole and put pressure on the entire line... eventually it would move the head.</p>  <p>EDIT: Eric Petroelje is right that you would need to do some serious digging to give yourself enough room to work and get the pipe around your footing hole.  But if the footing hole location cannot be moved then it might be necessary.</p>
996		<p>There is a really good place down in Houston, Texas. I love shopping at this place because of all the interesting old reclaimed building supplies they have, especially old plumbing fixtures, doors, windows, and doorknobs.</p>  <p>I checked their web-site and it looks like you can shop online: <a href="http://www.adkinsantiques.com/plugins/MivaMerchants/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=AAO&amp;Category_Code=05" rel="nofollow">Adkins Architectural Antiques &amp; Treasures</a></p>  <p>If nothing else they might be able to refer you to someone local.</p>
997		<p>There is a wide variety of router bits available online.</p>  <p>Handheld routers can be had for less than $200.  Some are even less than $100, but the ones I have seen have Â¼-inch shanks.  Some of the âinterestingâ router bits are only available for Â½-inch shanks.</p>
998	What are the different gauges of electrical wire available?	<p>What are the different gauges of electrical wire available for homes and how do you determine which gauge you should be using? If it helps, I'm wondering specifically about recommendations as I finish my basement.</p>
999		<p>This article has a full list and gives examples: <a href="http://electrical.about.com/od/wiringcircuitry/a/electwiresizes.htm">http://electrical.about.com/od/wiringcircuitry/a/electwiresizes.htm</a></p>  <p>For the most part though, 12 gauge wire is used for 20 AMP circuits and 14 gauge wire is used for 15 AMP circuits.  You probably can just use the 14 gauge wire in the basement (but it also depends on what you are doing in the basement as far as power requirements).  For example, these days a kitchen is always wired with 12 gauge/20 AMP circuits because of all the power demands.  The refrigerator will be on its own 20AMP circuit and so will the dishwasher.  Then depending on the number of outlets/counter space you may have one of more additional 20 AMP circuits.</p>  <p>The rest of the house is usually 14 gauge but the size of the house will determine the number of 15 AMP circuits for everything.</p>  <p>Also keep in mind that 14 gauge wire is much more flexible than 12 gauge.  So don't just go to 12 gauge just because... you will have a much harder time wiring everything if you do.</p>
1000		<p>Really there are only two sizes you'll need to be concerned about.</p>  <p>14 gauge ("white") wire is used for 15amp circuits and is what you will probably use for everything you are doing.  </p>  <p>12 gauge ("yellow") wire is used for 20amp circuits.  In a typical home these are used in the kitchen and sometimes for dedicated window AC unit circuits.  These wires are harder to bend and work with, and also more expensive.  Some people use 12 gauge everywhere in order to support space heaters.</p>  <p>There are also "three conductor" versions of both 14 and 12 gauge wire.  You probably won't need to use these for anything, but they are most often used for running multiple circuits in a single wire or for connecting 3-way light switches.</p>  <p>There are other sizes as well, but they are generally for specialty use (like for 30/40/60 amp circuits for electric dryers, stoves or hot tubs).</p>
