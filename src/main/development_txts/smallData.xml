First, weight.  A framing hammer is typically 20-32 oz, compared with 10-16 oz for a &quot;normal&quot; household claw hammer.  That helps it pound large nails in only a few blows.  Related to that is the much longer handle on a framing hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second is the face of the head: it's waffled to prevent slipping off the nail head, helping prevent bent nails.  A regular claw hammer will sometimes have a textured face but not nearly as pronounced, and the face may also be smooth.  A regular claw hammer often also has a domed face to allow a skilled hand to sink a nail below the surface with minimal surface damage: that's a feature you won't see on a framing hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, the claw is straight since it is optimized for prying boards apart.  A regular claw hammer is optimized for pulling nails.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're only building a garage, I'd recommend using your regular hammer rather than buying a framing hammer. (Or best of all, just go rent a nail gun!).  For inexperienced carpenters, the time spent hammering will probably not be what slows you down.  Also, the framing hammer is tiring enough that after a couple hours you may actually be faster with a smaller, regular claw hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do get a framing hammer I recommend a lighter one.  You'll work faster when you use it, you won't lose much power over a heavier hammer, and you'll feel much better on the second day.

However, a robust water heating system probably shouldn't be so simple.  How you want to configure things depends on what your exact situation is, and what features you want maximized.  Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 tank, parallel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;This kind of setup gives you the storage capacity of both tanks (say, 2 x 40gal = 80gal).  But it also costs twice as much to keep running.  I can't imagine why you would do this over the next idea, but I'm sure someone has a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 tank, serial&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;This gives you a lot of versatility in water availability and cost.  In low demand situations, turn the first tank down or off.  Storing the water will let it come up to room temperature, usually reducing the heating requirements in the second tank.  Set tank 2 for your desired temperature.  When demand increases (say, relatives visit for a week) turn the first tank up to boost the inflow temperature.  Ultimately, both tanks at the desired output temperature will give you slightly more hot water than the capacity of both tanks combined; due to heating as water flows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tankless&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;As mentioned by others, a simple tankless heater has hidden drawbacks in demand-based activation and flow restrictions.  However, the do not heat any water unless on, so their standby energy cost is nil.  Installation can be tricky: they require costly ventilation and exhaust systems which can make them not cost-effective over their projected lifespan.  And they are difficult to tie into hot water recycling systems, if you're looking for instant-hot water at the tap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tank + Tankless&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;You're getting into the area of boilers, and options for combining things do very different things.  A pre-warm tank can improve the flow rate of a tankless heater, by reducing the required temperature rise.  A post-heat tank can alleviate the demand-based problems, but adds the cost of continual heating and complexity in cycling cooling water from the tank.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;As I mentioned there are thousands of potential ways to combine systems.  Gas is cheaper than electric.  Tankless doesn't have standby costs.  Tanks smooth out warm water flow.  You have to determine your situation, and what works best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestion&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;It may be against the TOS to talk brands, if so someone remove this or let me know.  Since we're building a house this summer I've been looking into this problem, and our contractor pointed out the Eternal brand of tankless water heaters.  They have a 2 gallon internal tank that they keep warm, which supposedly fixes the problems of demand-based activation and still costs very little for standby heat.  They integrate well with recirculation systems, and can even be combined in multi-unit setups if demand exceeds one unit.

Small cuts and getting into corners are some things that it's great at. The example on some of the commercials about trimming some door frame to put in flooring is a perfect example of one thing it's great at. One thing that's especially worth a mention though is that it still has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; arc to the end of the cutting path. Not much, but some. The regular blade like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;^^^^^^^^&#xA;|      |&#xA;|      |&#xA;|      |&#xA;|______|&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;is one of the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've already used it to put together several projects. It does a fair job at cutting dovetails - though it doesn't tend to cut super straight through 2x4.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;safety&quot; part is pretty nice - you can touch the tip of the blade without getting your finger ripped off, but you wouldn't want to leave your finger there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also used the triangular sander and that seems to be really nice - I can see where the carbide piece would be &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; for removing tile cement.

It doesn't look or feel like any normal tool (drill, saw, etc) that's designed to be held. For the oscillator it's more of an after thought - but honestly probably the best form for the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I've discovered is that turning the cutting tool seems to be basically useless - my cuts aren't as straight or easy.

If you replace the entire box, you will need to rewire every breaker.  When the original box was wired there was lots of slack on each wire, but after each breaker was installed the wires would have been trimmed.  A good electrician will allow slack in the wires for reconfiguring breakers, etc. but if it's a small box you may not have enough wire, or you may end up running the wires in ways that aren't as neat or professional as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a new box, on the other hand, you only need to remove one 220V or two adjacent 110V breakers.  The old wires can be run into a junction box to provide as much length as you need for wiring into the new box. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Mike Sherov noted, you need to be sure that your service can handle the load and number of circuits.

LEDs are getting there, but not enough to justify the price and their light output is very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can only go with pin florescent if you have a florescent &quot;hw&quot;. that is the only thing that you can plug there by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never use Halogen. If it is a GU10 (line voltage), get a $20-$30 LED (MR16). you get 4W Vs 35W. Light output is lower, but you can get HW with simply more heads. Replace 3 halogen with 5 LEDs and you are fine in terms of light and energy savings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the halogen is a low voltage, things get tricky. You can just replace the head with a 3-5W bi-pin LED. they run $10-$20. They problem is that you need to make sure your low voltage converter will work. converters have what's called &quot;minimal load&quot;. For most of them, they expect a 35-50W halogen so they have a minimal load of 10-20. That means that when you plug a 3W LED, they may not kick in. you solve it by either using a remote transformer that feeds &quot;enough&quot; LED bulbs, or get a transformer that is &quot;led&quot; designed, but really all it means is that it has a minimal load of 3w and goes all the way up to something (I have a 3-60W for mono-points).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lat general tip: do not mess with dimmers. Just on/off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal choices:&#xA;For kitchen recessed light I got LED &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/blMkWO&quot;&gt;LR6-GU24&lt;/a&gt;. It is 12W, think that the florescent way would suggest I put a 23W bulb for each of these (I have 7). That means 50% saving. Same light output (they say it is 65W equivalent, but it feels like closer to 90W). No one can tell it is LED BTW, it is bright and even (not a &quot;pin&quot; of light, and well spread).&#xA;Cost efficient: great! less energy, and upfront cost was the same as getting a florescent can combination. (you may get cheaper florescent if it is not for a permit and you do the Edison type)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a bat lights I went with 3 mono points. Each has a transformer built in. I did not (suggest you never) buy &quot;LED&quot; lamps since you pay a huge premium for getting the LED HW. I just got the transformer with minimal load of 3W. I then threw away the GU5.3 Bi- Pin halogen and got &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/bkn4Gz&quot;&gt;Maxxima LED MR16&lt;/a&gt;. They are very good price (value) company. I compared the light to a $30 GE and these one are just as good. Notice that at 3W it is indeed just ambient light. good for over the bar in addition to some other light in the room.

You need to follow the manufacturer's directions (take photos!) if the warranty is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Careful preparation can double the installation time and increase the cost by 25%.  Whether it's worth it to you depends on how catastrophic a leak would be.  For me, my garage or shed gets minimal preparation since a leak doesn't matter that much - it can be patched when it stops raining.  For a house or any finished space like a nice studio, a leak will mean ruined drywall, etc. so more attention is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order from minimal work to a complete, nice job:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Minimum is a double course of shingles at the bottom of the roof.  The bottom course should be upside-down with the tabs cut off.  This is the minimum I'd do, maybe for a shed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Next up is covering the roof with roofing felt before installing the shingles.  This increases the longevity of the shingles and helps the nails hold. I'd do this for a garage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Best, if you're in a cold climate, is covering the roof with roofing felt then adding a 4' course of ice dam, which is a self-adhesive rubber membrane, at the base of the roof.  This helps prevent ice dams from damaging the shingles.  I'd do this on any roof over a finished space.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shingles are not self-adhesive, but you'll see strips of tar on the backside.  After you nail the shingles down, the sun will melt these strips and adhere each course of shingles to the one under it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing about the double-course of shingles that you start the roof with. The reason you cut the tabs off and reverse the shingle is to get that strip of tar at the very base of the roof.  The tar will melt and glue the first tabs down, helping prevent the wind from getting under the shingles.  For some reason many people I know, including my father who I worship, will put an upside-down course of shingles first without cutting off the tabs, to save time I guess. To me this is pointless since it does not do its job, which is to lock down the tabs at the leading edge of the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27" LastActivityDate="2010-07-22T20:53:32.170" CommentCount="0" />

I reread the question and see that @Vebjorn asked how to install shingles.  Doing a shed is a good project if you haven't shingled before.  Doing a house is harder because of the peaks and valleys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To shingle your shed, assuming a straight gable roof:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. Roofing felt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Buy a roll of roofing felt: you can get that at Home Depot or wherever. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Starting at the bottom of the roof, staple down a layer of roofing felt.  Just roll it out, then use a staple gun to fasten it at the top, bottom and middle about every 2 feet along.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the first layer is put down, add a second layer.  Overlap the first layer by about 6 inches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;B.  Shingles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with a layer of upside down shingles, with the tabs cut off.  Ask the person at Home Depot for a knife for cutting the shingles - it'll be so dull and gross afterwards you won't want it for anything else.  Position the shingles so the overhang the sides and leading edge of the roof by about 1/2&quot;.  Nail the 1/2 shingles with the strip of tar at the base of the roof, putting nails in the shingle 4 across, top and bottom, i.e. eight nails per shingle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Measure the width of the uncut shingle.  Measure that length from bottom of the 1/2 row of shingles on each side of the roof and make a mark.  Snap a chalkline between those marks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do the first &quot;real&quot; course of shingles.  Again, overhang by about 1/2&quot;.  Put 4 nails per shingle, about 1&quot; above the cuts that define the tabs.  Put one nail on each side, and one above each tab cut.  Use the chalkline  to keep them straight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Now the second course.  You want each shingle to be offset by 1/2 tab from the shingles below, and up by 1/2 a shingle width.  On the sides of the shingle are little cuts: bend the top part and that will give you a reference to &quot;butt&quot; against the lower shingle.  That will keep your shingles level.  Likewise, there is a cut on the top of the shingle, in the middle of the tab.  Bend that up on the first row of shingle (already nailed to the roof).  That will give you a place to butt the new shingle side-to-side, to ensure that the new shingle is well placed horizontally.  After the first one is placed you can just butt the shingles against each other, so only the tabs on the new shingle are necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you get to the end, cut off the flap as best you can straight with the line you want. Then go back and do the gap at the beginning: you can often use the cutoff from the end you finished to fill in the end you started.  (It probably wasn't clear in (4), but I like to start with a full shingle, then come back and fill in the bit at the beginning of the course).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continue until you get to the top.  The last shingle should fold over to the other side.  Then do the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C.  The peak&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Now you have two sides of shingles folded over.  You need to finish the peak.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cut a shingle into three tabs, cutting up-and-down at the tab slot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Turn a tab sideways, and fold it over the peak at one edge of the building. Choose the edge away from the prevailing wind.  It should be half-and-half on each side.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Measure how far down the peak it goes, the mark the same distance from the peak on the other side.  Snap a chalk line.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continue to nail tabs (1/3 shingles) along the peak, two nails per tab, using the chalkline to line them up.  You won't have the tabs to help you with the offset now, but by now your eye will be pretty good. :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finish up with a 1/2 tab.

This is very hard to determine, and takes sleuth work (look for wires entering the wall from floors above/below, and consider based on locations of other electrical if it's likely this wall is used to run wires). There are voltage detectors that MAY be able to detect the lines, but not guaranteed (though if they indicate, you know there's a line there for sure).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check for low-voltage lines as well (cable, phone, internet, doorbell, HVAC, speakers). &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These are probably even harder to find than high-voltage lines unless there is something on the wall that gives it away. Accidentally cutting one of these is a pain, but not nearly as dangerous or life-threatening as a high-voltage line. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check for plumbing &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This can include hot/cold water, waste lines and vent lines. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Waste plumbing works on gravity, and so it will usually take the shortest route. Find bathrooms/sinks and the main waste lines in the house, and see if this wall falls between them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Supply plumbing is hard to detect unless there is a fixture on the wall. Requires some sleuth work. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check for air ducts &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Relatively easy to determine: if there is a vent on the wall or you can see duct work connecting to it (cavities inside walls are often used as vertical ducts)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Can be a bit harder to find if it's used as a riser to connect horizontal runs between two floors. If it's above/below the main duct run then it's possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you remove a wall without re-running vents, you may be cutting off the supply or return to an area of your house, which can reduce air quality and comfort.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Central vac pipes&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generally the rule is to try and avoid as many turns as possible, and avoid going up towards the vacuum. Same idea as finding waste lines: find the vacuum and the wall ports, and if this wall is in the most direct path between them it's likely to have lines. You may also be able to hear them, especially if you put your ear against the wall and have someone suck up a small pebble or something noisy (but that won't damage the vacuum). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gas lines&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pretty unlikely to find gas running through the middle of a wall (especially one you're considering tearing out) but it's still a possibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Again, if the wall is the most direct route between the gas source, and the appliance (consider: water heaters, furnace, oven, BBQ), it's possible &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a commercial structure, the wall may be a fire wall (there will be doors on auto-closers separating this area from all others if this is the case - though check with your local fire department or building inspector). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if you are fairly confident there is nothing in the wall, don't just pull out the sawzall and tear through it - put some holes in it first to visually inspect for anything you might have missed. Most people will take all the drywall off at least one side before touching studs, as it gives that total check that everything is good to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="157" LastEditorUserId="157" LastEditDate="2011-03-24T03:57:17.143" LastActivityDate="2011-03-24T03:57:17.143" CommentCount="0" />

This is the other item that is huge to protect your hearing but then also make it much much more comfortable to do whatever loud do-it-yourself job you are working on.  You will notice a big difference between your stamina when wearing the ear plugs.  For instance, if you are pounding in nails, with the ear plugs in you won't notice the sound, but without them, the constant high pitched noise takes a toll on your ears (and wears you out for the job faster).  (They also are great for just blocking out noise to let you concentrate.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other basic safety equipment is work gloves.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="34" LastEditorUserId="34" LastEditDate="2010-07-23T11:35:48.317" LastActivityDate="2010-07-23T11:35:48.317" CommentCount="2" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-12-01T10:27:07.530" />

For historical reasons just about every domestic installation in the UK uses the same European standard voltage of 230V for every socket. In turn, almost all sockets used indoors are the same size and shape and deliver the same maximum current. (Some farms have three-phase 415V supply, but  I don't think that's often run to the house itself...!) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just in itself that introduces a whole level of complexity as the higher voltage is much keener on using a human being to find its way to earth. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, current. UK domestic power sockets are all rated at 13A, whereas in the US there's typically different sockets for different kinds of jobs. However, these sockets are joined in a &quot;ring main&quot; which is typically rated at 32A in total for all the sockets on the ring: so in theory connecting live and neutral on a ring main can deliver 230V * 32A = 7.3kW. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Makes for a nice bang. So it's wise to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Power in the UK is distributed from the supply company's meter to a &quot;consumer unit&quot; (these days, RCDs and circuit breakers) from whence the ring mains for sockets, lights and heavy equipment are powered. Like sockets, breakers are double-pole. The power company generally only provides a single-phase supply from their meter, it's an offence to tinker with anything upstream of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earth is typically a ground spike combined with a connection to the water main (if it's metal) or the gas main. Separate earth runs need to be made to exposed metal fixtures such as basins or bathtubs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most houses have two ring mains, typically upstairs and downstairs, and for convenience most have an upstairs and a downstairs lighting ring. Electric cookers typically and water heaters (immersion heaters) typically get their own spurs. Lighting, the ring mains, and high-current spurs use different sizes of cable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UK has been described as one of the most heavily fused countries on earth. As the ring main can in theory deliver 32A to the socket, each appliance has its own fuse built into the plug. That, along with the higher voltage and current, is one reason why the UK has such big plugs. These fuses are (these days) clipped into their own holder which can be (reasonably) easily extracted without taking the plug apart; they come in 3A and 13A sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's more, much more: bathrooms and other wet areas have their own special restrictions, there's regulations about how wires can be joined together, how many sockets can be on a ring, the distance between sockets, the number of spurs permitted, and so on and so on. A two year apprenticeship is a good start, as is careful digestion of the Wiring Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What can be done by a DIYer?

And it's frightfully expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with a bit of organization all you need to run is power, Cat 5/6 and Coax.  Cat 5/6 &amp;amp; RJ45 technically includes 2 phone lines, and even leaves Pins 4 and 5 as line 1 for RJ11 compatibility.  (Although never use a single wire for both phone and data, the ring voltage will kill your data.)  If you wire the entire house with Cat 5/6 and RJ45 plugs, you can use any cable as a phone line by just plugging an RJ11 into the existing outlet.  Very handy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After all that, a few multi-cables can be handy.  For example, something bundling Component Video, HDMI, and a few channels of audio can be very handy to connect an A/V stack in a closet to a theater room.  But you're still talking very short runs, as you'll just need a single trunk from point A to B.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="113" LastActivityDate="2010-07-23T21:03:17.923" CommentCount="2" />

A distribution transformer has a single-phase input (primary) winding. The output (secondary) winding is center-tapped and the center tap connected to a grounded neutral. The other two wires are the &quot;hot&quot; wires, and have a voltage between them of about 220 volts. The voltage between each of them and neutral is half of that. That is why our system is often referred to as a 110 volt system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ground and neutral share a wire from the electric company.&#xA;The neutral/ground wire gets attached to Earth Ground at the main breaker box, or at the meter (sometimes both).&#xA;The Earth Ground is usually both a metal stake in the ground, and the building's water line (if it is metal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main breaker panel is the only one where the ground and neutral buses are attached to each-other.&#xA;Even though the neutral and ground wires are connected to each other in the main panel, there may be a significant voltage between them near the end of a run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is never any loops in a properly wired building, with the possible exception of the ground wires.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most lighting, and electrical outlets, you use one of the &quot;hot&quot; wires, along with a &quot;neutral&quot; wire for power, along with a ground wire for safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The white neutral wire gets attached to the neutral bus, and the bare, or green ground wire gets attached to the ground bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hot wire is generally black, but may be any color other than white, or green. If a white wire is used as a hot wire it must be wrapped with electrical tape of another color.&#xA;Common examples of white wires being used as a hot wire include end-of-line light switches, and for devices which use 220 volts without a neutral wire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For switched lighting, and outlets, you &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; switch the hot wire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a given run the hot and neutral wires are always the same gauge. The ground wire is never smaller than the hot and neutral wires, in romex cable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Armored cable, and wires run through metal conduit can often be run without a separate ground wire. Instead you would use the armor, or the conduit as the ground connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For appliances which require 220 volts, you will use two breakers which have a connection between them which will cause both breakers to turn on and off together. Newer breakers appear to be a single double-wide breaker which works the same way. Because of the way most breaker panels are arranged, two breakers side by side will be on separate phases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There exists different plugs for each voltage, and current loads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The major exception is for 110 volts, at 15 and 20 amps. 20 amp receptacles have an extra slot on the hot connection, but are otherwise identical to 15 amp receptacles. You can plug any 15 amp plug into a regular 20 amp receptacle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is very rare to actually see a device which has a 20 amp plug on them. This is because you will often have 15 amp only receptacles on a 20 amp service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most devices have no fuses, or breakers of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="163" LastEditorUserId="163" LastEditDate="2011-10-28T07:46:33.727" LastActivityDate="2011-10-28T07:46:33.727" CommentCount="1" />

If you were looking to make this into a manicured lawn I'd recommend bringing in topsoil to cover up all the junk.  But since you're not, instead of an excavator I'd look into renting a compact tractor with a plow and a rake attachment.  Plowing will bring most of the junk to the surface and you can remove the bigger stuff by hand.  Then go around with the rake to smooth things out.  If you set the rake at an angle and go around in a spiral pattern starting at the perimeter, the bricks and rocks will all collect in the center.

It would also get rid of the need for X10 devices to draw small amounts of power even when off, which screws up CF bulbs which hate being fed small amounts of choppy power and flicker terribly on X10 circuits if there isn't an incandescent in the loop.

The concrete in your basement has cured enough to be structurally sound.

It includes a lot about behavior control, ie, keep them from wanting in your house to begin with, to keeping them out of the areas you don't want them in, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simplepestcontrol.com/ant-control.htm#biological&quot;&gt;Biological Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; section lists several natural ways of getting rid of ants:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your own boric acid bait to kill ant colonies.&lt;/strong&gt; Ant baits are the cornerstone of all ant control. Instead of spraying poisons everywhere, which can split colonies up and potentially make ant control more difficult, you bring the ant to the poison. The worker/foraging ants then take the poison back to the nest to share with larvae and queen. This is how colonies die, or are reduced to acceptable levels. Boric acid is a perfect ant poison. It’s cheap, natural, and much less dangerous (though not harmless) than commercial poisons. Best of all, when mixed correctly, boric acid is a slow ant killer – it allows ants time to bring it back to the nest in sufficient quantities for an ant apocalypse. Here are a few boric acid ant bait recipes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix three cups of water with one cup sugar and four teaspoons of boric acid (Borax). Pour around a cup of solution into separate jars. Pack the jars with cotton balls to about the halfway point. Seal the lid and poke a few holes at the center. Make a fun skull-and crossbones label and set the jars out in ant trails and hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some ants prefer protein and grease over sugar (little black ants, thief ants, pavement ants, big headed ants…). Replace the sugar in the above recipe with canned pet food. Or try this recipe: Mix four tablespoons of peanut butter with six tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon Borax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use diatomaceous earth&lt;/strong&gt; – the slow ant killer. Most ant species are susceptible to diatomaceous earth, a desiccant dust consisting of the fossilized shells of ancient algae. These shells are covered in microscopic shards which create cuts in the cuticle of crawling insects. The ants walk over the DE, start leaking, dehydrate, and die. You can apply DE as an ant barrier around the outside of your home or inside, around the perimeter of rooms and carpets (be sure it’s food grade). You can mix DE in water to make a paste to apply to trees. You can get proactive and dust nearby anthills. Using a duster, you can apply DE to the cracks, crevices, and wall voids, where it will remain effective forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capsaicin&lt;/strong&gt; – a natural ant repellent. Chili pepper, black pepper, red pepper, ginger, and paprika all contain capsaicin and so can be used to repel ants. I’ve heard of people using it as a barrier around homes, but it is best used in gardens. You can apply these powders around the base of plants or in wide bands (5-6 inches) between rows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citrus oils&lt;/strong&gt; kill ants. Linalool and d-limonene - citrus peel extracts found in products like Orange Guard, Citra-Solve, Bugs’R’Done and Pro-Citra DL Aerosol – can be used for ant control in a variety of ways. They can be used as a direct kill spray, a repellent in gardens, as a drench for anthills and outdoor nests, or for treatment of cracks and crevices where ants are nesting indoors (may stain).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2010-07-28T22:25:47.023" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T22:25:47.023" CommentCount="7" />

You'll need the wall plate, the correct inserts for it (they make 'em for F connectors (cable TV), RJ45 (twisted pair ethernet), RJ11 (phone), RCA plugs, and some can take extra wide inserts for HDMI, blanks to fill in any holes you won't be using, and a wall insert thing (not sure what it's officially called; it goes into the wall cavity to give you something to screw the wall plate down to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You hold the insert where you want it (which is anywhere there isn't a stud, pipes, or electrial), trace it on the wall, then cut out with a drywall saw.  Afix the insert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can then fish the lines through the wall cavity.  As we're not trying to go horizontal, you can just use a decent sized nut tied to the end of a piece of string.  Dangle it down, and grab it when it's at the lower hole.  If you're trying to get it into a very small lower hole, or it's not exactly lined up with the other one and your hands aren't small enough, bend a wire coat hanger into a hook to grab the string.  (note -- you want the string more than 2x the length you're going ... so you use one hand to wiggle the string if needed, while catching it with the other one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have the string fished through, tie the top end to something (you can temporarily place a bolt for the face plate into the wall insert, and tie off to that).  Remove the nut from the lower end and tie it onto the cables you're fishing.  Pull the string to bring the cables up.  Attach the cables to the inside of the prepared faceplate.

Because the furnace is installed in the attic, it is &quot;laying down&quot; on its side, and the incoming air is piped into what would be the bottom of the unit if it was standing up. We have intake vents in almost every room of the house (small vents, about 12&quot; long by 8&quot; tall). These vents go up to the attic, and they're all routed into a big metal box which is appears to be welded to the bottom of the furnace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because this is kind of hard to imagine, I mocked up a little image of my setup (this isn't my actual furnace, just a similar picture I found on Google):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://a.imageshack.us/img441/787/furnace.png&quot; alt=&quot;furnace mockup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have flexible ducts leading to the cold air intake &quot;box&quot; that is welded to the bottom of the furnace, and round flexible ducts leading from the hot air &quot;box&quot; to all of our vents (which are in the ceiling).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem I am having is that I can't see where to install a filter! I can remove the front panel and see the bottom motor, but there's no where to actually put a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lennox.com/pdfs/manuals/Lennox_G40UH_Manual.pdf&quot;&gt;User's Information Manual&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This unit is not equipped with a filter or rack. A field-provided high-velocity filter is required for the unit to operate properly. A filter must be in place whenever the unit is operating&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have any idea what a &quot;field-provided filter&quot; is. When we bought the house, there were a few destroyed filters in the attic next to the furnace (all of different sizes, a few cut to different sizes, but no filter in the furnace. It looks like the previous owners had no idea either. So, for now, we've just been running the furnace without any filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there something I can do to put a filter in? Is it really harmful to run the furnace without one? Should I look into putting filters in all of my little air intakes around the house?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; As is usually the case with me, I put off worrying about the furnace until it started getting too cold here at night. I finally climbed up to the attic and took a good look at the furnace. There isn't any indication of where a filter should go, and no slot to slide it in or bar to hold it in place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the air intake area - you can see the circulating fan on the right, behind the control board:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/O7jvV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put the filter along the bottom - a 14x25x1 fit snug across the whole side (bottom if it was standing up). I had to fold and bend the filter some to get it inside the furnace. The only thing that seems to hold it in place is the body of the circulating fan:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/SWrpL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="3312" LastEditDate="2011-09-06T15:47:07.577" LastActivityDate="2015-07-29T16:20:03.707" Title="Where should my furnace filter go in a Lennox G40UHX series furnace?"

Otherwise water pools, accelerates rotting of the wood and makes the deck slippery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second is expansion.  Given that outdoor boards are alternately soaked and baked, there is significant shrinking and expanding of the boards (another reason for gaps).  That will be most pronounced in the width of the board versus the thickness. As the board expands it pulls out the nail.  If the nail is pounded into the edge it will pull out more since there is more expansion in that direction compared to a vertical nail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Screws don't pull out at all, and that's their principle advantage and why I always screw down deckboards. Nails are preferred by many, but I haven't seen them nailed into the edge, and I think it's for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: if it's a composite as others have suggested, everything I just wrote is a waste of pixels.

You don't want that on your basement floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The water that drips through the lines is condensation, and therefore very clean.  The water won't have any crud in it to deposit in the line.

Those deposit pigment on the surface of the wood and penetration is minimal.

Penetrating sealants will certainly give you a bit more time to clean up a spill but they won't prevent a stain: that's why tabletops are usually finished with a film finish, and if they're not, you use coasters and place mats.  You wouldn't want to use a film finish to a deck because it will certainly peel in short order as the wood expands and contracts under rain and sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't bother.

It's also reasonable to use adhesive in addition, as long as it won't eat through the styrofoam (or other material), of course.  The styrofoam was actually surprisingly strong when I was drilling screws into it.  Given that they used somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 screws on the 4' wide floor-to-ceiling sheet of drywall, I have no concerns about it coming down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are electrical outlets and phone jacks on our ICF walls, and the lines and boxes are accommodated by carving out appropriate cavities.  That creates another factor to consider when drilling into the ICF wall.  Specifically: how straight are the channels that were carved out, and in which direction were they carved?  Did they use nail plates along the route?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as far as attaching things to the wall &lt;em&gt;securely&lt;/em&gt; is concerned... I doubt it would be equivalent to a stud in terms of support capacity, and I'm having trouble finding information on this topic online.  If the drywall is attached directly to the ICF, you won't have any cavity behind the wall to place a spreading-type anchor, so those are ruled out.  Of course, if you make the assumption that the wall is at least as strong as drywall on its own (indeed, I'd assume it's at least a little stronger), you can use a self-drilling drywall anchor (Lowe's has one branded &quot;TOGGLER&quot;) and get plenty of capacity.  Plus, you can use them in any location (excluding wire runs, as noted above) without worrying about hitting a stud after you've bored a giant hole in the drywall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="399" LastEditorUserId="399" LastEditDate="2010-08-05T02:55:24.477" LastActivityDate="2010-08-05T02:55:24.477" CommentCount="1" />

These will usually have an access hatch (or several small hatches) for maintenance, so they should be easy enough to find.  Typically a pipe will run from the water supply to the valve box.  From the valve box pipes will run out to the various sprinkler heads.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each valve in the valve box represents a single zone.  When the sprinklers come on, a valve will open and all the sprinklers in that zone will come on at the same time.  You can tell (roughly) where the pipes will be for that zone by finding the shortest path from the valve box that connects all the sprinklers in a zone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as you dig carefully, you shouldn't have too much trouble.  The pipes are usually pretty tough and are usually buried about a foot or so under the ground.  If you do run into one, you're not going to be able to move it without doing some serious trenching, so you'll most likely be stuck moving your hole instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="44" LastActivityDate="2010-08-05T13:06:51.507" CommentCount="0" />

If you run into an irrigation line you can most definitely move it.  Just use an extra piece of pipe and a coupling on either end (plus two hose clamps).  Lowes or Home Depot will have the right sized coupling and hose clamps for your line diameter.  I have broken my sprinkler line twice in my garden (the line runs directly underneath) and patched it both times like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to pull too hard on the line or you could end up pulling the entire line under the ground and move the attached sprinkler heads.  In other words don't just try and stretch the line around your hole and put pressure on the entire line... eventually it would move the head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Eric Petroelje is right that you would need to do some serious digging to give yourself enough room to work and get the pipe around your footing hole.  But if the footing hole location cannot be moved then it might be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="34" LastEditorUserId="34" LastEditDate="2010-08-05T13:24:29.447" LastActivityDate="2010-08-05T13:24:29.447" CommentCount="2" />

You probably can just use the 14 gauge wire in the basement (but it also depends on what you are doing in the basement as far as power requirements).  For example, these days a kitchen is always wired with 12 gauge/20 AMP circuits because of all the power demands.  The refrigerator will be on its own 20AMP circuit and so will the dishwasher.  Then depending on the number of outlets/counter space you may have one of more additional 20 AMP circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the house is usually 14 gauge but the size of the house will determine the number of 15 AMP circuits for everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that 14 gauge wire is much more flexible than 12 gauge.  So don't just go to 12 gauge just because... you will have a much harder time wiring everything if you do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="34" LastEditorUserId="34" LastEditDate="2010-08-05T14:30:07.100" LastActivityDate="2010-08-05T14:30:07.100" CommentCount="4" />
