Storing latex paint in hot garage? The final color of the paint depends on the ratios of the different pigments in the paint, and those ratios won't change once the paint is mixed. The storage instructions on all the interior paints that I have say nothing about high temperatures, just to protect from freezing which I believe would cause the paint to de-emulsify. That said, a paint can's lid doesn't form a perfect seal, and higher temperatures are going to cause volatile chemicals (including water) in the paint to evaporate faster than normal. (I've noticed that paint that has been left open for a while and thinned with water behaves differently than a can of fresh paint -- I can't define exactly how, but it just doesn't paint as well). However, given that it can take weeks for a coat of paint to cure fully under normal household conditions, if the can is sealed well, my SWAG is that it would take years before you'd notice a change in the paint.
How should laminate flooring be secured next to brick? I want to install laminate flooring in a family room that has a brick fireplace. Part of the laminate would be directly next to the brick base of the fireplace. What kind of base-board or base-piece would I use to secure the edge of the laminate against the fireplace? -M
Is there any reason to be wary of vinyl windows? Consumer reports "buying guide" for replacement windows recommends fiberglass or wood windows over vinyl. I've also heard from various sources that some vinyl windows can warp with expansion and contraction over time. I'm wondering if I should avoid vinyl replacement windows in general? Do people's bad experiences with vinyl stem from the cheaper end of the spectrum? Do quality brands of vinyl windows exist? There seems to be a lot of potential propaganda/fear-mongering/crazyness about vinyl windows on the Interwebs. For example here. These websites make my bs detector go off... It seems hard to find a non biased opinion on the subject.
Is there any reason to be wary of vinyl windows? When we did this, we purchased edging to match the laminate. The edging snaps into a channel, which can be attached to the floor - either glued or screwed, depending on the sub floor. I found after a couple of years the edging came up a bit, but a bit of glue in the channel fixed that.
Is there any reason to be wary of vinyl windows? One way of accomplishing this is to undercut the brick and slide the flooring in underneath. Two advantages are that the brick ends up holding down your floating floor, and you end up with a very clean looking transition between the brick and laminate. To do this, you'd of course need something that can cut brick. You could potentially use an angle grinder or jamb saw with a diamond blade, but either of those would be pretty dusty. To cut down on the dust somewhat (or at least reduce the degree to which it gets blown around the room), I'd recommend a multifunction oscillating tool. Fein makes the original one but it's pricey at ~$300. I have a kit from Rockwell that's about half that and love it, and you can get a version from Harbor Freight for about $35 but it's got some iffy reviews and it doesn't appear to come with a diamond stone-cutting blade. As an added bonus this is an incredibly useful tool that would almost certainly come in handy in other parts of your flooring job (trimming jambs, etc) and in other projects as well.
Is there any reason to be wary of vinyl windows? If it's a floating laminate floor (i.e. it isn't glued to the floor, but just rests on a foam underlay or padding) then you shouldn't attach the flooring to the walls at any point. You can cover the spaces around the edges of the walls with baseboard, but this should just rest on the floor, not be connected to it in any way. This is because a floating floor may expand, contract, or shift slightly due to changes in temperature or humidity, and if it's attached at any point the laminate flooring pieces may separate due to the strain. When I put my flooring down, there were gaps around the fireplace and near the door leading outside, so I simply used some tinted caulk to fill the gaps. You can usually find caulk tinted to match different wood colors, so it should blend with the floor easily. And since the caulk will expand and contract a bit, it works fine with a floating floor.
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings My wife and I are considering buying a house that was built in the 1960s and has acoustic "popcorn" ceilings. I want to know if there is a cheap, effective way to do a home asbestos test. I'm still reviewing some of the inspection reports but I don't think they've specifically checked for this. Tips, anyone? -M
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings Thanks for the advice. I have found following detailed instruction on procedures to check insulation with IR thermometer: Determining Insulation and Air Infiltration Levels Using an Infrared Thermometer I have decided to buy a Black & Decker TLD100 Thermal Leak Detector, which seems to be an IR thermometer with some additional functionality to make finding hot / cold spots easier by coloring the aiming light dot. I will write here later my experiences. After a week of using TLD100 I have to say my experience is mixed: it really works extremely well for its primary purpose, i.e. checking the house insulation using it to check heating system is a bit tricky, as IR thermometers do not work very well with reflective surfaces. In my case the heating pipes are from copper, which is quite shiny, and the insulation around them is a mineral wool finished with aluminium wrap, which is very shiny. Because of this, measuring their temperature with IR is very inaccurate, a contact thermometer would probably do a much better job. That said, the same limitations would apply for IR camera, as the principle is the same in both cases.
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings As with anything, quality counts. The benefits of vinyl (or uPVC as they're called in the UK) is that they require less maintenance than wooden windows. However, a properly maintained wooden window will outlast a uPVC window - it's just harder and more time consuming (sanding, painting etc.) to to. I have heard stories of uPVC frames that were made without a metal (usually aluminium) core - which would warp badly - but I've no evidence to hand.
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings There's an issue to be concerned about in high-crime areas -- they're plastic, so they can melt. Someone interested in breaking into your place can take a torch, heat up the frame of the window, and push the window or the whole sash in. Some vinyl windows aren't all vinyl, and have an aluminum or steel core, that might reduce this from being able to happen. Also, vinyl isn't good for high-heat areas. A south or west facing window in a hot climate might heat up enough through the day that it'll warp. This is even worse in dry areas with large high/low shifts each day. In colder climates, vinyl becomes brittle, which means if you're in a windy area with gets a lot of blowing wind, you could get debris thrown into the window which can crack the whole frame; and unlike other construction, you can't just replace the glass, you have to replace the whole sash. Vinyl on its own isn't all that strong -- so there's a lot of vinyl involved -- if you're trying to get a lot of light into a room, you'll be able to get more glass into the area with just about any other material. You also can't paint them easily. Whatever color they are, that's what they're going to be unless you replace 'em. This isn't typically a concern for most people, though, as most vinyl windows are white -- but they'll slowly yellow over the years, depending on the exact mix of vinyl. This is more pronounced in areas with higher UV indexes. (eg, high elevations with no shade trees) Vinyl also outgasses. If you've got someone in the family who's sensitive to chemicals, this could be an issue. ... That's not to say that there aren't different qualities of vinyl windows, but don't just buy on price -- look at internal metal stiffening, if it's welded or screwed together (you want welded), if it's fully encased in the vinyl (so it won't oxidize), and there's certifications now for vinyl windows ... but I think it's an industry effort, so I don't know for sure how reliable it is.
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings Yes, you can get this test kit for about $10. You have to cut out/scrape off a sample to send to a lab. (Make sure you wet the area first to avoid any airborne particles.) You also have to include another $30 with the sample for standard analysis. Instructions here.
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings I've never seen a pocket door in an exterior wall, but there are the "barn door" style sliding doors that might be able to be used, if you don't mind the fact that you wall they slide against can't have things hung on it, and there's exposed hardware. I have no idea how well they'd seal (and that may not be an issue, as yours sounds to be a former external wall), but with the way they're hung, you'd have the opportunity to use a much thicker and heavier door. You could also go with @gbroiles' comment, and then frame in the stationary side of the sliding glass door to make it look more like a pocket door. (and possibly paint the glass door, or put something onto it, so it looked less modern, if it's an architectural issue)
Tips To Inspect/ Popcorn ceilings E-Z Patch 2 patching compound has a wide variety of colors to pick from. I don't think it's spray-on though. Posts in this forum mention that Behr 1-Part Epoxy can be used on cool decks for pools. However, also note that this will cause loss of functionality of your deck - it won't stay as cool as when it was unpainted.
Fiberglass reinforced vinyl windows -- better/worse/same as being reinforced with aluminum/steel? My wife and I are looking at Sunrise replacement windows. They seem to be very sturdy windows with a nice lifetime warranty. I've heard that I definitely want to get some kind of structurally reinforced vinyl window as vinyl by itself is not very strong. In looking at how these windows are reinforced, the best I've come up with is this statement: FiberCore Plus, a pultruded fiberglass I-beam reinforcement that is coupled with urethane insulation comes with every door to add to the strength of the design. (from here) How does Fiberglass compare to aluminum/steel reinforcement structurally? Is fiberglass reinforcement sufficient/superior/worse? Should I be concerned with fiberglass reinforcement in any way? How will the reinforcement material impact the window's lifespan? Note, I'm in the Mid Atlantic (Maryland).
Fiberglass reinforced vinyl windows -- better/worse/same as being reinforced with aluminum/steel? Buy quality, name brand windows. The previous owners of my house installed vinyl windows in 2002. They are all breaking in one form or another. Either from warping, broken tilt-in latches leaking seals, or any of about a half dozen other issues. An extra $50 a window would have gotten Andersen, Pella or Marvin windows with 10-15 year warranties that would still be working great.
What kind of fastener should I use to attach a mounting bracket to metal studs? I want to hang a 26 inch flat panel monitor on a wall that has metal studs. What kind of fastener should i use to attach the mounting bracket to the stud through drywall?
What kind of fastener should I use to attach a mounting bracket to metal studs? I'd imagine steel stud drywall screws should work fairly well if you've got 20 gauge studs. They've got a finer thread than regular drywall screws, and are self-tapping. This forum has some discussion on the topic as well.
What kind of fastener should I use to attach a mounting bracket to metal studs? It depends on the type of mount. If it's an articulating arm mount, the bending moment at the wall is going to be a lot higher than if you're doing a flush mount. In that case the safest option would be to open up the drywall and put 2x4s inside the metal studs, and use the included wood screws to attach the mount to the new 2x4s. If this is a load bearing wall, and you're certain the studs are heavier 20-gauge load bearing studs, you might get by mounting an articulating arm using toggle bolts like these. If the wall is non-load-bearing, it's likely made of lighter 25-gauge studs, which just don't have the localized rigidity to support this type of mount so you're stuck reinforcing with 2x4s as I described above. If you're doing a flush (or nearly so) mount, then you can get by with toggle bolts even if you have the lighter studs. I wouldn't recommend any kind of self-tapping screw in a load bearing application like this. It doesn't take much overtorquing (especially with 25-ga studs) to leave them just on the verge of pulling right back out.
Improve AC flow to secondary ducts I have an AC which has 3 ducts coming out of it. Only one duct gets flow - I'm guessing the AC fan blows right into it. What can I do to improve the flow?
Improve AC flow to secondary ducts You need to restrict the flow through that duct, either by installing a damper like this in the duct, or by installing an adjustable register at the duct outlet, and closing it off until you get similar flow out of all three ducts.
Improve AC flow to secondary ducts Consider that the world is moving towards having only two types of wiring: Electricity (120VAC or whatever your local standard is) Data (IP over Ethernet over Cat5e) Coax will be increasingly useless as video is delivered to a receiver over IP. Speaker wire will be only be used within a single room, with each room having its own amp and IP-based music receiver. Phones are increasingly IP-based (and even POTS phones can use Cat5e runs in the interim). Wired data will always have an advantage over wireless, especially in densely populated areas like condos. It's likely that Cat5e will eventually be replaced by something though. For that reason, try to build in such a way that it's possible to retrofit other cable later on. So to answer your question: No, don't bother running lots of different physical media to each room. Run lots of data and power, and run only as much of the other stuff as you actually need today. My bet is that you won't need more of it as time goes on, you'll need less of it.
Improve AC flow to secondary ducts micRo - ~$2000 (Need to buy a few pieces). This thing looks really nice, but has a small work area. The guy that makes them is fanatical about quality hobby equipment. http://lumenlab.com DIY - ~$750. If you want to take the DIY approach and have a larger work area, pick up a copy of Build Your Own CNC Machine. The companion website literally has videos of the guy making the machine on a kitchen table with hand tools. I'm half way through the book and it appears surprisingly straight forward.
What are my options for replacing 50W GU10 lightbulbs? I've been looking at replacing 50W GU10 halogen lightbulbs for something more energy efficient. Some people say that LEDs cannot give you the same light (even 10W LEDs), and to use 11W CFL instead, like the ones from megaman. I need these light bulbs for both my kitchen and my living room, so I don't want to be surprised by way dimmer light bulbs. What's the current state of this?
How do I hang a chair from a concrete ceiling from a single hook? I'm putting in a "hanging chair" in the basement and it's supposed to hang from a single hook in the ceiling. The ceiling is reinforced concrete. Now, I'm about 125 kilograms (275 lbs) so I reckon the hook should easily be able to bear twice that for safety. Is that a good enough margin? What would be the easiest and best way to mount a hook in the ceiling that will hold about 250 kgs (550 lbs)?
How do I hang a chair from a concrete ceiling from a single hook? Your margin of error sounds a bit low - one thing to bear in mind is that while the static force of you in the chair is half the rating of the hook, the peak force will be higher as you "drop" into the chair. If you can get a bigger hook it might be worth it. If you have a hook on a plate then you'll spread the load across more bolts thus each one won't have to bear the full weight.
What are some of your previous owner nightmares you have inherited? Things like picket fences that are screwed and to end and to trees with no posts. Or where there are posts they are sunk 4 inches into the ground with concrete around the top. Or plumbing done with automotive parts or using the sump pump to empty the washer runoff. Or main fuse boxes that are wired up with no rhyme or reason.
What are some of your previous owner nightmares you have inherited? We installed underfloor heating in the top two floors of the house and when we lifted the floorboards in each room we discovered the redundant wiring from at least two or even three previous rewires of the house. I eventually had to resort to carefully opening junction boxes and testing the circuits to see if they were still live. I think that there are still some lengths of wire buried in walls that we can't get to.
What are some of your previous owner nightmares you have inherited? That sounds like it would work but its involved. I do what you do and use the double stick tape on the flat top of the sill. Then before I shrink the plastic I get normal clear packaging tape and go around the whole window again. I get a lot of draft and condensation and over the years this technique evolved and seems to work.
What are some of your previous owner nightmares you have inherited? I've found some low energy equivalents on Amazon (UK site). 6 GU10 Lectrolite branded 11w = 50w Low energy saving warm white light spotlamp bulbs. I've no idea how good they are, but a search for "GU10 low energy" turned up some other choices too. If you can find them at a local hardware store they might have some on show (though if it's a DIY barn it's hard to get the true effect of the light).
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? I have an area just at the end of my current patio that I have tried to grow grass in for a few years with no luck. The area is heavily shaded, it is between two large maples. Plus I have two large dogs that don't help matters. No matter what it always reverts back to a few bits of grass and very sandy/dry soil...yes I have put topsoil down when seeding. If I could grow crab grass there I would. I just want something to make it less muddy when it rains. The area is fairly large so using normal pavers would cost a fortune. Money I don't have. Does any one have any other idea's? Spaced pavers with something inbetween? poured concrete sections? Crab grass seeds?
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? The previous owners of my house were too cheap to buy wire nuts, every junction is just taped. Every time I simply want to change a switch, I end up rewiring the entire circuit. Not to mention the hidden junction box in my bathroom hanging loose with no cover and taped up connections, I almost had a heart attack when I found that.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? We bought a house from people who had, lets call it, questionable taste in decorating and color schemes. One of the first things we needed to do was take down the hideous wallpaper in the family room, and paint it a reasonable color. It turns out they'd applied the wallpaper directly to the drywall - no primer, no paint, just paper glued to paper. We ended up using an oil-based primer to seal it, and then painted over it. These same people had replaced carpeting at some point. Rather than get rid of it, they piled it - sometimes 3-4 layers deep - in the damp crawl space. Talk about smell! Fortunately, it cleared up when we got rid of the carpet.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? What about putting down sod to give the area a jump start?
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? You could make your own pavers.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? I'd recommend a concrete epoxy for this application. It's expensive at $19 but is stronger than a mechanical anchor, and you can sink a standard eye bolt in there for a nice clean look. I'd recommend a heavy 1/2" one like this -- that one is 6" long, but if the ceiling is thick enough you could bury most of it in your hole so just the eye is exposed.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? Courtesy of This Old House magazine, pour a concrete pad, carve patterns in it and paint it.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? What about a Rubbermaid container? The kind they have to hold ice and drinks/kegs seems about the size you want.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? In a house we rented a while back, the previous tenants tried (and failed) to install a dishwasher. Apparently, they were too cheap to find an adapter to hook up the waste flow from the dishwasher, so they cut a hole in the waste line of the sink on the wrong side of the trap and epoxied a piece of PVC there. Then they hooked up the waste hose from the dishwasher and let it sit on the floor. This caused dirty dishwater to flow back into the dishwasher where it sat and stagnated, and if there wasn't enough stagnant water in the hose, sewer gases would leak up through the dishwasher. They also failed at the wiring, so the metal parts would occasionally carry some voltage and shock you if you're just unlucky enough. Good times.
What is a cheap patio solution for a muddy area in my backyard? You could make a path with crushed rock or stones (maybe crushed rock in between) and surround the path with a cheaper ground cover like pine straw/mulch where you could eventually put plants. This way you allow access to where the area leads and avoid having to cover everything with the expensive stuff.
How should I address my bathroom's flickering lights and GFCI tripping mysteriously? (Schematic included.) So I inherited a bit of a nightmare for wiring in my bathroom. I'll be calling in an electrician, but wanted to have an understanding of the problem first, as not to be ripped off, lead astray, etc.. So here is the setup/symptoms. The entire bathroom is run off one 20amp line (both outlets and lights). It is a pretty small bathroom, but has a bit of a complex circuit. The line comes in from the breaker box, and splits in a 1-gang junction- one side of the split goes through a GFCI, the other is passed through non-protected. Both halves go into a 3-gang junction box. In this three gang junction, the GFCI protected branch goes into an outlet, then off to a switched light above the toilet (the switch is reachable from the toilet, which is why I think they GFCI protected it). The non-protected branch goes off to the main lights over the sink, a fan, and a recessed shower light over the shower. The symptoms- when this circuit is on, the whole house lights flicker occasionally. Turn the circuit off, and the flickering goes away (it seems that when the shower light is on the flickering increases). Also, occasionally the GFCI trips when the fan is turned on. Now the fan is on the branch that is not protected by the GFCI, which worries me a bit. So my questions are: 1) Why would the GFCI trip when the fan is turned on sometimes? 2) How bad is this wiring setup (see schematic)? Was the electrician a moron? How might it be cleaned up? 3) What would cause the whole house lights to flicker? I was thinking there may be some arcing going on somewhere in this mess. Where can I look on my own, or suggest to the electrician? 4) Should the recessed shower light be GFCI protected? Does the toilet light need to be? It seems that those two branches should be swapped.
How should I address my bathroom's flickering lights and GFCI tripping mysteriously? (Schematic included.) For future reference- there is no need to buy these kits. They are essentially selling you a zip-top baggie for $10.00. Simply wet the area, and scrape a very small sample into a zip-top bag of your own. Then place this bag into another sealable bag (i.e.- double-bag the sample). Then you can call one of several national testing labs, that will perform the test for around $10-15/sample, and email you the results. Google asbestos testing labs. Some labs will only test for professionals, but many will take home-owner samples- you just have to call around a bit.
How should I address my bathroom's flickering lights and GFCI tripping mysteriously? (Schematic included.) Do any of your light fixtures have CFLs or other fluorescent bulbs installed? I've read that fluorescent starting ballasts can cause these types of problems with GFCI outlets, even if they're upstream of the GFCI and not on the branch it's protecting. It's also possible that your GFCI outlet is bad -- does it trip when you press its test button? Anyway, as long as the 20A circuit going into this bathroom is not shared by anything else in the house, this diagram looks fine. Light fixtures aren't required to be GFCI protected, only outlets are, but there's nothing that says they can't be.
How should I frame in a large window opening to install a smaller window? I'm replacing some windows in my house. The original window openings were outsized for the rooms, so the replacement windows I've chosen are smaller, which means framing in the part of the opening that I won't be using. The first window that I'll be replacing was off-center in the wall, so I'll be installing the new window to one side of the opening so that it will be closer to the wall's center. As I see it, I need to create two pieces of framing -- one for the side of the window and one for underneath (I think a single L-shaped piece would be structurally weaker). There are two ways that I could build these pieces: one where the side piece fills the opening vertically with the bottom piece at its side (Figure 1); the other where the bottom piece fills the opening horizontally with the side piece and window resting on top (Figure 2). Figure 1: Side framing piece fills opening Figure 2: Bottom framing piece fills opening Have I considered all the options for how to build the new framing, and is there an advantage for one method over the other?
How should I frame in a large window opening to install a smaller window? If you were framing this opening from the start, figure 1 is the way it would be done. I would go that direction so it will make sense to anyone working in this area of your home in the future. Did you consider the possibility of centering the new window horizontally in the existing opening? That may result in a better proportion. In that case I would still use the approach in figure 1 with new vertical sections on both sides extending the entire height of the opening.
How should I frame in a large window opening to install a smaller window? I bought a house, knowing that there was water damage from a leak in the roof. After starting the repair/remodel I found out why there was a leak. Someone decided to make more room in the kitchen by cutting a hole in the wall to the closet on the other side and putting the refrigerator in the hole. Unfortunately the closet was in an addition, so the wall was the former exterior wall of the house, and naturally load bearing. They didn't put a header in after cutting the hole. So there's this hole cut with a sawzall in the wall, stretching across two studs, whatever finishing material was put outside of them in 1948, a layer of bricks, because it's a brick house and the studs on the other side of the brick in the addition. Give it a little time and you'd be amazed how much water can come in through that. The closet was demolished already and this is what we found after taking out the wall in the kitchen.
How should I frame in a large window opening to install a smaller window? Sure sounds like you may have a couple of unrelated problems. Usually, a nuisance tripping GFI is a sign of a worn or aged GFI device. This is assuming there are no down line devices or lights that are leaking small amounts of current to earth ground. This would be uncommon for a light or simple switch, more likely with a motor load on start up or shut down. The more important and potentially dangerous problem is the whole house lighting flickering when the fan and shower light is on. If you have an accurate digital VOM, you can look at the voltage drop at the breaker that controls the bathroom. If you see variations of much more than 5 to 10 volts then isolate which device is causing the fluctuation. (fan or bath lite) by turning them on individually and test again. A older fan is a common source of your problem as moisture and humidity may have invaded the motor and causing larger than average voltage drop to ground. If this fan is in fact the culprit, the fan may be heating up more than normal as well and could become a hazard. If you do not have a VOM or know how to test voltages inside your circuit breaker panel, I'd advise you to seek a licensed electrician soon to correct the situation.
How should I frame in a large window opening to install a smaller window? A very easy and inexpensive solution is to attach 1/4 round or bed molding directly to the brick, but resting on the flooring. You can use a good grade construction adhesive to attach the trim to the brick, I prefer PL for masonry in a case like yours, but any good urethane based adhesive will do. Glue any mitered corners of the trim with Titebond II wood glue. Good luck
How should I frame in a large window opening to install a smaller window? I would suggest you use the method in figure 1. It is conventional, easier and uses less material.
Can I replace an improperly supported tub easily? I have a fiberglass garden tub in the home I just bought that wasn't installed right. The far side has no support under the lip and as a result it likes to loose its seal to the tiles above. My current solution has been to recaulk it every time it cracks but this has gotten rather annoying over the past few months. Is it possible for me to rip out the tub and either replace it or fix the supports without redoing the whole shower area? (ie tile and plumbing). Does anyone have any recommendations on howto do it?
Can I replace an improperly supported tub easily? The tub should be supported underneath where it sits on the subfloor, not just at the lip. Usually the manufacturer specifies that the tub be set into a bed of thinset mortar to make sure it's well supported across the entire bottom surface. We have a tub that's doing the same thing. The easy fix is to remove all the caulk around the edges, then fill the tub with water before recaulking, only draining the tub after the caulk has had time to dry fully. This ensures that the caulk seam stays mostly in compression even when the tub is full of water and people, reducing the chance that it will get pulled apart. I've done this to ours and it's lasted well so far (granted, it's only been a few months now -- we just moved here in April). What I'd eventually like to do, as our fiberglass tub still creaks when you walk in it, is to open up the adjacent wall and try to get thinset mortar underneath the tub. My plan is to gently pry the base of the tub upward with shims, then slather mortar underneath as much as possible, and then remove the shims so that the tub settles into the mortar. This might be an option for you, but it might involve some tile work depending on where you can get access to the subfloor under the tub. I know this doesn't do much to answer your specific question about the feasibility of removing and replacing your tub. That's difficult to answer without knowing exactly how your tub is installed. I have to think that's going to be a big job though, no matter how it's installed.
Can I replace an improperly supported tub easily? The problem is, if you just add an extension to the patio, it just becomes more paved ground. I suppose you could just pave your entire yard... Hey, that would eliminate the mowing! I'd also point out that many dogs seem not to love crushed rock under their feet. I know ours does not, and our last dog also seemed to shy away from those areas too. And smaller crushed stone seems to get dragged into the house too easily, scratching up floors. So my thoughts would go to mulch, if the area is too shady to grow anything. Yes, there are plants that thrive in shady areas, so that is an option. It depends on your goals for the area, and how large are your dogs. Large dogs can be an issue with plants, as large quantities of urine tends to burn plants. In the end, I'd be looking to put down a thick bed of mulch there. Mulch is inexpensive and easy to put down. You might choose to put a ground cloth under the mulch, to inhibit weeds coming through.
Is it ok to have mixed grounds and neutrals on bars in a breaker box? So to continue my line of electrical questioning (and perhaps narrow down my flickering light problem), I took a look through the two panels in this house. There is a 200amp main service in the basement, which then feeds up to a 100amp sub-panel for the main floor. This 100amp sub feeds a kitchen (fridge, microwave, dishwasher, gas range), a bathroom, 3 bedrooms, and a living room. The 200amp main feeds the 100amp sub, 2 bedrooms, a living room, a washer/dryer (gas dryer), a utility room (well pump, pressure tank, gas water heater, gas furnace), and an A/C. My first concern is that the main service panel has the bare ground and neutral wires mixed on the two bus bars. Reading around, some say this is OK, other's say it is bad. Any thoughts? The sub-panel is wired with grounds and neutrals on separate bars. My second concern- is a 100amp sub sufficient for the main floor?
How much should replacing septic tank lids cost, and what is involved? My wife and I may be possibly buying a house with a septic tank. We had it inspected and the report showed that the tank was in good condition however the "tank lids" would need to be replaced. I'm going to call around to get prices for service however I was hoping to have a ballpark figure so I know what I would be getting myself into... can someone provide me with some estimated costs? Are we talking hundreds of dollars here? Thousands of dollars? In addition, how complicated of a process is it to replace the lids?
How much should replacing septic tank lids cost, and what is involved? National Electrical Code 2014 Article 250 Grounding and Bonding II. System Grounding 250.24 Grounding Service-Supplied Alternating-Current Systems. (A) System Grounding Connections. A premises wiring system supplied by a grounded ac service shall have a grounding electrode conductor connected to the grounded service conductor, at each service, in accordance with 250.24(A)(1) through (A)(5). (1) General. The grounding electrode conductor connection shall be made at any accessible point from the load end of the overhead service conductors, service drop, underground service conductors, or service lateral to and including the terminal or bus to which the grounded service conductor is connected at the service disconnecting means. This means that the grounded (neutral) from the service must be connected to ground, and that the connection can be made by bonding the neutral bus bar to the grounding electrode. (5) Load-Side Grounding Connections. A grounded conductor shall not be connected to normally non–current carrying metal parts of equipment, to equipment grounding conductor(s), or be reconnected to ground on the load side of the service disconnecting means except as otherwise permitted in this article. This means that the grounded (neutral) conductors should only be grounded at the main service disconnnect. If the main service panel happens to be the same place that the grounded (neutral) conductor is bonded to the grounding electrode, then there is no problem mixing grounds and neutrals on the same bus bar (as long as there is an appropriate number of conductors terminated under each lug). If the two bus bars are not connected; as would be the case anywhere other than the main disconnect (exceptions exist), then you cannot mix them. Notice how the grounded, and grounding bus bars are connected in the main service panel. This means that; electrically speaking, they can be considered a single bus bar. Which means that both grounded (neutral), and equipment grounding conductors can be terminated on either bus bar. In the subpanel, the bus bars are kept separate. So grounded (neutral), and equipment grounding conductors cannot be mixed.
What is the advantage of PEX pinch clamp vs. crimp rings? I just saw these for the first time today at Lowe's: The advantages I can see over the crimp style are: A single tool can work with multiple PEX sizes That single tool is cheaper than a single-size crimp tool (~$40 vs ~$80) The tool grabs and pinches the raised segment of the clamp, so it doesn't need to wrap around the tube which should make it easier to use in confined spaces Has anyone used this type of ring for PEX work and have any thoughts on them?
What is the advantage of PEX pinch clamp vs. crimp rings? To some extent, this is going to depend on the lids required by the manhole material, and local codes. In our area, for example, both concrete manhole covers, as well as bolted down plastic covers are acceptable. That being said, either way it shouldn't be terribly expensive, if it is only the lid that needs to be replaced. For example- I just had a pump tank and elevated drain field added to my system. The tanks that were put in had plastic corrugated manholes, and I opted for plastic lids (the manhole can then be brought down to ground level, and you can mow right over the lid). IIRC the lids themselves were $75/each or so. They just use a 6" lag screw that goes into the plastic manhole (if it is a matter of simply replacing existing plastic lids, you can probably do it yourself). From my conversation with the installer, he said that using the concrete lids (same type that we have for the primary tank) would be around the same price. I have no idea what the old steel lids cost, but I would guess they are a bit more pricey. In terms of the labor- if it is just replacing the lids, and no work needs to be done to the manhole, I would guess an hour job at most. If the existing lids are plastic- just unscrew the lag screw, pull the old lid off, put the new one on, and screw down the lag screw. If it is a concrete lid, just dig up the lid (ours were a couple inches under ground, except for the PVC pump tube), pull up the handles, pull off the old lid, place in the new lid. Throw the dirt/sod back on top.
How often do septic tanks typically need to be pumped? At the risk of potentially asking an off-topic question, I'd like to better understand the maintenance of a septic tank. I've never had one before and am unfamiliar with how to manage one. My primary question is: how often do septic tanks need to be pumped? We're looking to buy a 4/2 house with a concrete septic tank "supposedly" with a capacity of 2250. My secondary question is: how should septic tanks monitored? Just an annual scheduled service check-up? I don't want to spend money needlessly but also don't want to neglect something that needs regular attention.
How often do septic tanks typically need to be pumped? The pumping question depends on your local codes. In our area, a brand new tank is good for 5 years before it needs to be pumped. A non-new tank must be pumped every 3 years. This is pretty typical. I would say that tank monitoring will vary depending on your system. A septic tank is a pretty simple system. You have a primary tank (some call it a settling tank) that settles any solids out of the wastewater, and where most of your breakdown occurs (a well operating system will have natural occurring bacteria that do a good job of breaking down "solid" waste). As an aside, this settled goo is the majority of what is pumped out when the pump guy comes. Usually, there is a second tank that is gravity fed, where the now "grey water" flows. From here, the grey water sits for a while (more breakdown occurs here) and it either feeds by gravity to a drain field, where it filters through the ground, or, it is pumped to a mound/elevated drain field. In a simple non-pump system, you want to watch out for clogging in the outlets to the secondary tank and to the drain field. This can be done pretty easily- when you have the manhole covers replaced, ask the guy doing the work for you to tell you how for down from the top of the manhole, the drain is. Now, as often as you want, put a stick down the manhole, and see how deep the water is. If the water is above the drain, you have a blockage, and it should be serviced. If you have a system with a pump, I'd highly recommend getting an alarm if one isn't installed already. The alarms will alert you if the level of the water goes above a specified height, which indicates a clogged pump or filter. My recommendation would be to do your own monitoring (checking water level) as often as makes you comfortable, and have a scheduled service every 2-3 years. More important than monitoring however, is making sure you are diligent with prevention. Use as little toilet paper as is practical, and stay away from quilted TP. Additionally, nothing but toilet waste, water, and TP should EVER go down your drains (the exception to this is if you have a food disposer, but even then, I'd use the disposal sparingly). Also, try not to use too harsh of chemicals when doing cleaning of your sinks/toilets/showers, and NEVER use draino.. there are cleaning products that are septic friendly, and septic friendly drain de-cloggers. Use them. This keeps the bacterial ecosystem breaking down your waste, nice and happy, which is a good thing.
How best can I discover what is up with my electrical bill? This might be subjective, I don't know. However, it's a serious problem for me. My electrical bill is outrageous. It's three times as large as my next-door neighbor, and four or five times the size of my neighbor's across the street. It's worse in the summer (I live in central TX), but I've had the air conditioner inspected, and while the house is right at the maximum capacity for our unit, the unit should still be able to take care of the load. That also doesn't explain why our winter bills are larger than the comparables. What I would like to do is check the amount of current drawn by each running appliance and calculate where all my money is going. I just don't know how to go about doing this.
How best can I discover what is up with my electrical bill? For devices that plug into an electrical outlet, you can use Kill-a-Watt or equivalent to monitor how much electricity they're using. If that doesn't give you a clear culprit, one low-tech method is to look at the electric meter as you turn off circuits at the service panel one at a time until you see a big change in speed at which the wheel is spinning (for older meters) or the digits are changing (newer meters). If you can narrow down what's using a lot of electricity, you can look at devices one at a time on that circuit to see if one is using more than its fair share.
How best can I discover what is up with my electrical bill? Turn off and unplug everything and I do mean everything. If the meter is still showing that you are using electricity the you have a fault with the meter and you should report it to your utility company.
Are discount furnaces safe to use? More newbie questions ;-) The house we're looking to buy has an older furnace that "may be manufactured by the Permier/Consolidated furnace company" according to general inspections. We're in the process of getting it inspected by a heating professional. If we need to get the furnace replaced, I'm wondering what kind of costs would be involved... Cost Helper mentioned that the costs of a new furnace could be anywhere from $7500+. Yet I also found some at Alpine Home Air for $550+. That's a substantial difference in cost. What's the difference here? Are there safety concerns that more expensive models don't have?
Are clogs in the AC condensate drain common in Florida? I have a two year old central A/C unit. Every 2/3 months the unit shuts off. I called the rep/maintenance company and they have given me the following response: The cause of the issue is algae building up within the drainage line This is due to the climate in Florida This is extremely common, and in fact comprises the majority of their service calls Their solution is to: Shop vac the drainage line Pour bleach down the line I have asked co-workers, family members in state, and a friend who's father has been in A/C for a few decades in the south an no one else has heard of this / has this issue. This was most definitely not explained during the purchase of the new unit. Does anyone know if this normal? Am I getting hosed?
What direction should laminate flooring be placed in? I'm thinking of installing laminate flooring and have a question: If I'm installing laminate throughout the house, should ALL of it be going in the same direction? Say for example, let's say I have a hallway that is perpendicular to a large living room. --------------- |             | |             | |             | |             |-------------------- | | |             |--------------------  |             | |             | --------------- In the layout above, would all of the laminate be installed "left to right" for both the living room and hallway? Or could it be installed in one direction for one room and installed in a different direction for the other room?
How can I build a cheap, do-it-yourself dance floor? I would like to make a cheap DIY dance floor and I attained a roll of 3.5 ft x 6 ft vinyl linoleum for free. Can I use this in making a dance floor? Has anyone built their own cheap DIY and what materials did they use? Has anyone failed at doing this and what should I avoid? Are there any good guides to doing this on the internet?
How can I build a cheap, do-it-yourself dance floor? I learned that you should install hardwood flooring with the long edge parallel to the long dimension of the space it's being installed in. I expect laminate flooring would be the same. This would be for the whole house, not just one room. I definitely wouldn't change directions at the entry to the hallway.
What is the difference between Square D and QP single pole circuit breakers, and can they be mixed? I just noticed that all of the branches from my upstairs service box are run off of 15 or 20-amp type QP circuit breakers, except for one 15-amp line that is for the hard-wired smoke alarms- it uses a Square D type breaker. What is the difference between these two, and can they safely be mixed in a breaker box?
Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don't properly test as grounded? It's me again -- the pest ;-) On the general inspection report for the house we're looking at buying, there's a note about the house's electrical: Some three prong outlets did not test properly grounded. This may be an indication that the wiring in the walls is the older ungrounded type. We recommend considering upgrading to grounded type wiring for safety enhancement. How big of a safety concern is this? Is there any other explanation for faulty ground tests? What corrective action would be necessary? I'm concerned that fixing this would require the entire electrical lines to be replaced... If so, any thoughts on how expensive that would be? I'm guessing quite a bit. What's strange is that the report does mention that a ground is present on the main panal: Grounding system is present. The grounding electrode was buried and not fully visible at the time of our inspection. Wood screws are used to secure the dead front cover to the panel. This is improper because they have sharp ends and can damage the protective coating in the wires inside the panel. We recommend installing proper screws. The inspection report also recommended adding GFCI outlets. Would that help at all?
Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don't properly test as grounded? Some research says that a QP circuit breaker is the 1" or 2" wide breakers that protect a 110V or 220V circuit respectively, and is made by Siemens. Square D is another manufacturer of circuit breakers and service panels. Ideally, you would want to have all your circuit breakers be manufactured by the same company that makes your service panel; the manufacturer will -- one hopes -- certify that their breakers will work correctly in their panels. Some manufacturers produce breakers with the same mechanical fit as others, in which case it would be up to that manufacturer to say if their breakers will work in a panel made by the other. I'm assuming that the Square D breaker actually fits in the service panel, so to determine if it's OK, you'd have to do some research to see if Square D certifies their products to work with the panel, or if the panel's manufacturer does the same. (Side note: per NEC2008, smoke detector circuits have to be protected with an AFCI if there's a detector in a bedroom. This might explain why that circuit is different.)
Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don't properly test as grounded? If an outlet has a ground terminal, it should be grounded. No ifs or buts. (And IMO, giving the illusion of ground protection is even worse than not having any protection.). I don't think you can even get two-prong outlets any more, so I think you'll have to fix the wiring. It sounds like you're still negotiating, so this is a good bargaining point. And if you don't get it fixed now, when it comes time to sell, any potential buyers would be within their rights to make you fix it then. An easy way to check that your wiring has a ground conductor is to open up the service panel, look for the breaker that controls those outlets, then trace the black-shielded wire to where the cable feeds into the panel. (If it's present, ground is unshielded.) If you have grounded wiring at the service panel, the next thing to check would be to look inside the outlets in question to see if the wiring there is grounded (it may just be a loose connection, and since it's common to daisy-chain outlets in a room, one faulty wire could affect several outlets). If you have don't have ground at the outlets, but did at the service panel, you probably have a junction box joining the older ungrounded wiring and newer grounded wiring. Time to go exploring in the attic or crawl-space / basement. GFCIs detect a difference between current going out on the live terminal and current coming in on the neutral terminal. If you're the easiest path to ground in an electrical fault, a GFCI will detect that and break the circuit; without a GFCI, you'd have to hope that you draw enough current -- and for long enough -- to trip a regular circuit breaker. On the whole, though, I'd rather that current was running to ground through some copper that's intended for just that purpose.
Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don't properly test as grounded? If the house has two-prong outlets or three-prong outlets that are not actually grounded, it may mean that there is older knob-and-tube wiring. It's common for much of the house to be have been rewired while leaving a few circuits knob-and-tube. Knob-and-tube wiring may prevent you from getting insurance and can be a fire hazard, especially if you were to blow insulation into walls without knowing that they have knob-and-tube, so it's important to find out if you have it. It's also possible that there is modern, three-connector wiring, but that the ground was never properly connected. Finally, part of the circuit may be grounded but an extension ungrounded. That is is fine in most rooms, but if there is no actual ground, the outlet should be replaced with either (1) a two-prong outlet, (2) a GFCI-type receptacle marked with the words “No equipment ground,” or (3) a three-prong outlet protected by an upstream GFCI and marked with the words “GFCI protected” and “No equipment ground”. See section 210-7(d)(3) of the National Electrical Code. I would start by removing the cover of one of the ungrounded outlets to look for knob-and-tube there. Next, I would look for knob-and-tube in the basement and around the service panel. Your home inspector would probably have mentioned any visible knob-and-tube wring, but it can't hurt to take another look. It's possible that parts of the circuit is still knob-and-tube even though the visible portion (connecting to the service panel) has been replaced. Try to trace the circuit from the service panel to the outlets in question, and open any outlets and junction boxes along the way to understand what kind of wiring is used and how it's connected. If you need to rewrire a few outlets of the entire circuit, the difficulty and cost depends on how hard it is to access the affected areas. Fishing cable through old walls is a daunting task, and it's often necessary to make holes in the drywall and patch it again. A trick for first-floor outlets is to leave most of the circuit in the basement ceiling and drill up to each first-floor outlet.
Is it unsafe if some three prong outlets don't properly test as grounded? The instructions for the last type of laminate flooring I installed actually recommended not selecting the direction based on the longer dimenension of the room, but based on how much light is coming in from each wall, and to select it so the planks ran perpendicular to the wall with the most light. If you're going to break the floor and rotate it at the hallway, I'd say fine, just install a transition, and if you're going to add it to any additional rooms in the future, consider rotating them relative to the hallway, too, so all of the transitions are the same. Snap a few boards together, then a second set, and take a look at how they look placed next to each other where you enter the hallway -- you'll want to see it with the room lighting to see how it looks. If you didn't want to break it, and with all other considerations being equal, I'd not look at your problem as two smaller rectangles, but as two sets of walls ... and there's more linear feet of walls running one direction than the other, so there'd be more cuts running the boards across the hallway rather than down.
What is the best way to remove spray paint from a blacktop driveway? I have an area on my blacktop driveway that some kids thought needed some spray paint, what is the best way to remove it without damaging the blacktop?
What is the best way to remove spray paint from a blacktop driveway? I'm betting that a pressure washer would remove it. It might also remove the blacktop though. It would also be very time consuming. You might be better off using a solvent.
Small amounts of moss on asphalt shingles? What's the best way to remove moss from asphalt shingles?
Small amounts of moss on asphalt shingles? Anything you do to dissolve the paint or with a pressure washer will also remove some asphalt. I'd vote for a good pressure washer, as tar can be messy stuff since it too will probably dissolve under the action of paint stripper. Rent one if necessary, BEFORE the paint has had time to harden is best. Once that is done, however, you will still be left with an image of what you stripped off. So I'd next take the opportunity to apply some blacktop sealer to the entire driveway. Finally, ensure that the kids who did it will not repeat the action. Their paying for the work will help in that respect. If they are required to help do the repair itself, that would be best.
Small amounts of moss on asphalt shingles? I live in South Florida and I too have to do this. My house has 2 AC systems. One of them clogs up after about 3-4 months, the other never has. I'm not sure what the difference is, but ever since I started putting a bit of bleach in the condensate line every time I change my filters; I've had no clogs since then. Assuming this is actually your problem, I would suggest that you do the same.
Small amounts of moss on asphalt shingles? I don't know about the shop vac, but I've heard the bleach suggestion numerous times and it sounds reasonable.
Doors are sticky and noisy when opened? For some reason, the doors in our house make a very loud "unsticking" sound when you open them. It's almost as if the paint isn't cured, since the sound seems to come from the contact area around the frame, where the door touches the doorframe -- but this house has not been painted in 5 years. This loud "unsticking" door opening noise doesn't seem like a big problem, and I suppose it isn't, but since I'm a night owl, so when I open doors it tends to wake my wife up. And that's not good for ye olde marital harmony. What can I do to make the doors in our home open more quietly without this sticking sound? Should I somehow lubricate the frame (I'm worried that it'll collect dust or other particles and look bad)? Maybe use sandpaper to rough the paint up so it's less likely to stick?
Doors are sticky and noisy when opened? Is there anything on door frame like draught excluder? In the UK this is often foam or short bristle but can be "P" shaped rubber strips. It could be this that's sticking to the door, particularly if it's old and has got dirty. If you remove this does the noise go away. Another possibility is the hinge, but the noise you describe doesn't sound like the sort of noise a hinge would make. A drop or two of light oil will lubricate the hinge - something you might want to do anyway.
Doors are sticky and noisy when opened? By what you're describing, I assume you have paint on the outer edges of the door and the inside of the door frame. Paint doesn't make a good lubricant. And the door may not have been fitted to have the clearance for a coat of paint, or three coats if its an older house. And then when its humid and the door expands a bit, the paint rubs catches against the paint on the other surface. If that is true, you could sand down or strip the offending parts until they clear each other without touching (and possibly repaint with a single coat if you need to). I'd expect sanding only to "rough it up" to increase the friction, not make it better.
Tips and advice for repairing front yard stairs cheaply? The front yard concrete stairs at the place we're looking to buy are in need of eventual repair. Some of the steps are different sizes creating a trip hazard. In addition, some of them have large cracks. Is there an easy way to repair them short of completely demolishing them? I'm wondering if it would be possible to "encase" the old stairs in new concrete; thus creating a new frame with more consistent sized steps. Can that be done? Or is there perhaps another way to tackle it? I'm not a fan of demolishing the whole thing and starting over.
Tips and advice for repairing front yard stairs cheaply? Is your sticking sound accompanied by what feels like a little drag on the door as it clears the jamb? If so, then the door is rubbing on the jamb. First check the tightness of your hinge screws, and if they're all reasonably tight and you're still getting the rubbing, you'll need to sand or plane down the offending edge(s) of the door and repaint. If there's no extra drag, and just a little pop as the door first breaks away from the stop (the moulding it closes against when fully closed), then it's likely the paint is just a bit sticky. I'd try giving it a good cleaning with 409 or something. If that doesn't help, for a quick and easy fix you could try to isolate where it's sticking and strategically apply some scotch tape just to that area inside the stop moulding where the door touches. Shouldn't be too noticeable. If you want to fix it the harder but more correct way, you'd need to repaint.
How can I stop my lights from dimming when major appliances start up? So it appears that I narrowed down the cause of my Random Flickering- the faulty 20-amp circuit on the detached garage service panel (leaking 60 volts at some point between the breaker and the last outlet). Once I kill that breaker, all of my random flickering seems to have stopped (and that breaker will not be turned on until that branch is either re-wired, or a specific cause is found). However, now I have noticed a slight dimming whenever the A/C, Fridge, or well pump/pressure tank kicks in. From reading around it looks like this slight dimming tied to major appliances kicking in is not something to be too concerned about. And when it comes to the Fridge and A/C, it isn't an issue for us. Where it does get quite annoying is with the well pump/pressure tank. Whenever water is running (doing dishes, laundry, taking a shower, etc..) the pump kicks in every 10-15 seconds or so, giving the whole house a nice 10-15 second "beat" of lights dimming. Is there anything I can do for this one appliance circuit to reduce or eliminate the flicker?
How can I stop my lights from dimming when major appliances start up? I just got a new place with the same problem, and the inspector mentioned that wood can expand due to heat. The A/C hadn't been working, so the house had been hot in the summer months while it sat on the market. He said not to adjust the doors until after a month of running the A/C. He said if they didn't contract to normal size, I'd have to use a belt sander to shave the edge off.
Is it worth having two locks in exterior doors? I've noticed that some places have a lock in the knob and a deadbolt in the exterior doors, and some places have a knob without a lock and just a deadbolt. Is there a benefit to having a lock in the knob I'm missing?
How should we sand and treat our Victorian floorboards? We have recently bought a new house, well a new old house. It dates from 1900, we have taken the carpet up ad are now looking to sand back the exposed original floorboards. We plan on giving the floor a light sanding, as it smooth just somewhat dirty/cosmetic imperfections. Is the correct process to use a fine sandpaper, and then possibly an intermediate if necessary ? We will be using a large commercial floor sander. After sanding we envisage the wood being a lot lighter, and therefore we will need to stain it. What stains are best oil/water/spirit based ? How many coats of stain are required ? After staining it is necessary to apply a varnish ? We intended to apply two coats of clear varnish. The first coat can be watered down, as it is used to seal the wood ? Does our plan look like a good one ? Edit Just in case anyone is interested, the floor is all done. We used 3 coats of ronseal diamond hard floor varnish. Before the final coat of clear varnish we sandpapered with fine grain by hand, and wiped with wet cloth/let dry for couple of hours. This got rid of a number of cloudy marks that were present and caused, I think, by our slightly imperfect sanding. So one thing I learn't - don't be afraid of the rough paper and really giving the floorboards a good going over. We got them smooth, but there is substantial variation in colour where different amounts of wood were taken off by the sanding/levelling process,however we quite like this the distressed/aged look; They are over 100yrs old after all.
How should we sand and treat our Victorian floorboards? It might be better if you didn't stain the wood. We have varnished the floors in nearly all the rooms in our circa 1900 house and in each case we used clear Ronseal Diamond Hard varnish - it's quick drying and "does what it says on the tin" * - and with three coats it still darkens the wood quite nicely. It isn't necessary to stain before varnishing and most varnishes don't need diluting. In a couple of rooms we stained the boards, but only because we had to replace some and the new ones were the wrong colour. In those rooms is was a case of two coats of stain on the new boards and one on the old. Any more and the wood becomes too dark. The best thing to do is to stain a piece of board in areas with one, two and three coats plus leave an area plain, then varnish. This will give you an idea of what the final effect will be and you can compare the different levels of stain against each other.
How should we sand and treat our Victorian floorboards? Think of the electricity flowing into your house just like water flowing through a pipe. If you turn on a faucet only halfway then you will probably not notice a drop in pressure elsewhere in the house. But if your washing machine is filling (or your irrigation system kicks in, etc.) then you will see reduced pressure elsewhere in the house. The electricity in your house works the same way. Air conditioners, refrigerators, water pumps, draw a lot of electricity when they first start up and you may see a drop in "pressure" when any of those items turn on: Air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, furnaces, etc. that have large motors require enormous amounts of power when the motor first starts to spin up to speed. Once the motor is spinning, the energy requirement drops way down. This instantaneous need for motor shaft speed is what causes that momentary dimming of your lights. Reference: http://www.askthebuilder.com/QA_Lights_Dim_When_AC_Comes_On.shtml As @Tester101 mentioned in the comments, you could look into a service upgrade to your house (which might not be a bad idea) but the problem might also be with your water pump. The pump kicking on/off every 15 seconds may indicate a problem with the pump itself (capacitor or pressure leak) or possibly an incorrectly sized pump for your usage. You probably want to look into a new/repair/upgrade of the water pump.
How should we sand and treat our Victorian floorboards? The lock in the knob can be set to be locked when the door is closed. In other words, you do not have to do anything extra to lock the door, just pull it closed. This can be good or bad depending on how you look at it (it can be easy to lock yourself out this way). The dead bolt on the other hand always requires an extra step to lock the door (put the key in, lock it, and remove the key); this forces you to have a key in hand, preventing you from locking yourself out. Depending on what you are doing/replacing, also check your local building codes. Some types of deadbolts (the ones that require a key on both sides) may not be allowed in certain situations.
How should we sand and treat our Victorian floorboards? Mechanically, just scrape it off, but you will need to do so carefully. A piece of ply wood would do - it will give you a large edge to scrape the maximum amount of moss off, but won't be too sharp which will reduce the chance of it digging into to the shingles. Work down the shingles starting at the fixed edge that way you won't potentially lift them. You might want to look at why it's forming in the first place. If the shingles are shaded and constantly damp these are ideal moss growing conditions. Prune any overhanging trees and make sure any gutters are clear.
How should we sand and treat our Victorian floorboards? From a security point of view two locks is better than one. Some insurance companies might require that you have a deadbolt type lock, offering reduced premiums if you have a recognised standard one fitted.
How does one know if a well pump is "Short Cycling" or pressure tank is water logged? Is there any calculation that can be performed to estimate the amount of water a well water pressure tank should output between pump cycles? E.g.- I have a 40 gallon pressure tank (non bladder) with a pump switch set to 40psi on, 60psi off. I suspected the tank was water logged, as when taking a shower, the pump would kick in every 15-20 seconds, which seemed short. I ended up draining it, pressurizing the empty tank to 35 psi, then having the pump refill it, and now I am getting 2-3 minutes between pump cycles, so obviously recharging the tank was helpful. This worked out great, but was more of a gut feeling. Is there any calculation to see if a pressure tank has too little air? (i.e.- something like my system should output XX gallons between pump cycles).
How does one know if a well pump is "Short Cycling" or pressure tank is water logged? First, a quick note on technique - start with a coarse grade sandpaper on the floor sander and work down to the the finer grade. The coarse grade removes the old finish and levels out the imperfections, then the fine grade makes it nice and smooth. If you go the other way around, you'll definitely curse every time you see the grooves in the sunlight. Fixing this means stripping off the nice new finish, not fun. In passing, an obvious-in-hindsight but sometimes-missed point is to go with the grain, i.e. sand along the boards, not across them. In any case your sander will complain bitterly if you don't. Also, give the boards an incredibly good wash before you start with e.g. Sugar Soap - you want to try and strip off everything gungy to stop the sandpaper clogging too often. Leave for at least 24 hours to dry nicely. Be sure to hire an "edge sander" too, this will help you get to the edges that a drum sander won't get to. If you can, remove the skirting boards (baseboards) as then you can get right underneath; only do this if you know you're redecorating the walls too and don't mind patching up the woodwork. You'll inevitably end up doing the fiddly bits around the door frame and right in the corners yourself by hand with a scraper or sandpaper, which takes longer than you could possibly imagine. While doing the sanding, remove everything from the room (obviously) and get heavyweight dust sheets to tape around the door. Wear airtight goggles as this is an insanely dusty process. You'll also need ear defenders as this is an insanely loud process too. Regarding stain, it's a matter of personal preference. I've done both and prefer the more uniform result that stain gives. Regarding finish, I've used both oil-based and water-based finishes. Both are OK, but the oil-based one looked richer (can't say why, can't say how) -- and took about three days to dry. Somewhat inconvenient for a hall, and our puppy left nice pawprints. Follow the instructions on the tin; in general thinning probably isn't worth it, as you'll find the second and subsequent coats will go further anyway. I applied three coats of the oil-based finish, and five of the water-based finish, but this depends on the state of your boards. It's handy to rent good bright work lights so you can see where you've been, especially for the second and subsequent coats. What is important is that you get flooring-grade varnish, regular varnish won't stand up to the first party, and yacht varnish will cost so much you won't have the first party...
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? When I shut off a water faucet or right after the toilet tank refills after flushing, I hear a vibrating sound in my pipes. It last between one and two seconds. On the interwebs, I found out that it's called "water hammer" and that it can be fixed by draining my plumbing system: by shutting off the water main and opening up all the faucets and flushing all the toilets in the house. Well, I did that and it helped for two, maybe three days. What do I do next (other than call a professional)?
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? I tried the LEDs, the look is precisely like a Bulgarian chip-shop. Ugh! That's a technology that will take a few more years to sort itself out: fine for those solar-powered lights they give away in garages, but not for indoor use just yet. The Megaman CFLs have a nice, gentle light but take a while to warm up. They're also quite deep (roughly three times the depth of a halogen GU10) so won't work in every fitting. I don't think they'd work well with dimmer switches either. In the end I've been gradually replacing my 50W bulbs with 35W ones, without really noticing the reduction in light. But, perhaps I put too many in to start with?
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? If the painted surfaces are sticking to each other then a rough-up sanding may help. If they're rubbing then yhw42 may be right that friction could increase but since you'd be removing a little material it may decrease resulting in a wash.
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? This normally happens near quick-acting valves in your plumbing system, like those used in a clothes washing machine. Those valves are opened by a solenoid and get slammed shut by water pressure, and all that water coming to such an abrupt stop can rattle already-loose pipes, cause them to become loose, or in the worst case damage them over time and cause leaks. That's why water hammer arrestors are commonly installed near washing machine outlets (it may be required by code, I'm not sure). They look like this: They work by maintaining a reservoir of air inside that vertical tube. When the column of water is stopped abruptly by a valve, the air acts as a cushion, compressing so that the water can slow down more gradually and impart less inertial force to your pipes. These are fairly easy to install even for someone with no plumbing experience. I believe the one pictured is designed to be mounted inline with a sink or toilet connection, and they also make models with standard garden hose style threads for a washer connection. You shouldn't need to install these at every fixture; one set (hot and cold) for each bathroom/kitchen should be plenty. Since your problem seems to occur on (relatively) slower-acting valves that shouldn't be generating an unacceptable amount of water hammer, you may also just have a section of pipe that's not mounted properly. If you're only noticing the banging sound in one area, it may be possible to open up the wall there and install some pipe clamps to keep things from moving around and making noise. This would be a more difficult job than installing arrestors (but potentially cheaper if you do it yourself).
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? At 2.5 GPM, your 2-3 minutes of shower time between cycles is using between 5 and 7.5 gallons. If your tank starts at 60psi and 7.5 gallons is enough to bring it down to 40psi, that means you're starting out with 15 gallons of air in your 40 gallon tank, and ending the 3-minute cycle with 22.5 gallons of air. I calculated this using Boyle's law, or P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. And of course these numbers would be different if your shower head is higher-flow and your 3 minutes of showering used more than 7.5 gallons. I believe to get the most output from your tank, you want it to be nearly empty of water when the pump is set to come on. That means draining and charging it to just below the pump setting, as you did. If you wanted to get a little more cycle time you could probably even go as high as 38 psi. Note that with a bladderless tank, you're going to need to recharge periodically as the air in your tank is gradually absorbed by the water. For what it's worth I think 2-3 minutes is well within your pump's design cycle time. 15-20 seconds was way too short and by noticing it and fixing it you've probably saved yourself an expensive pump replacement.
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? I picked up one of these yesterday and it works great. No problem getting it in between my floor joists, and it doesn't appear to be as finicky about keeping the tool exactly perpendicular to the tubing. As for the different style bands, I'll update here if they start leaking. :)
How do I fix a "water hammer" problem? Moss is there for a reason. It grows because there is moisture. Typically overhanging tree limbs and shade are the problem. You want to cut back the branches over the house so that your roof will get sufficient sunlight and airflow to dry out. Once you do that, a good stiff push broom should be sufficient to scrub off the moss from those shingles. Check for roof damage. That moisture is a killer. It is possible that you will need to replace shingles, or even the wood underneath. You may also have venting problems, preventing the roof from properly drying out. Finally, once you ensure that the roof can dry out, and remove the moss which helps to keep it moist, and replace/repair any problems, you can then add zinc strips to the top of your roof to help retard moss from returning. The zinc leaches out gradually with rain, retarding new moss or algae from growing on your shingles. Nothing will work unless you dry out the roof and keep it dry though.
Building code in Canada Are there any online resources for determining building code requirements in Canada? For example right now I need to know what the proper diameter for a dryer vent to the outside should be. Last week I needed to know how high a flight of stairs can be before hand railings are required . I called the local municipal building inspectors' office to get the answer (24", 60cm). It was successful, but it took 3 attempts to get a hold of someone in the office who could answer. Surely there's an easier more direct way?
Building code in Canada MarkD already gave a really good by the book answer, but let me answer from the side of a homeowner who has had septic tanks for around the last 20 years. The only time I had any maintenance/inspection was one time when my yard was getting really swampy. I had a septic guy come out and he pumped it rather cheaply, no permanent damage, no big whoop. Those Rid-X commercials with the bathroom full of backed up waste seem like an exaggeration to me. We try to go easy on the chemicals, but we aren't that diligent about it. Definitely no drain cleaners, but chlorox goes in the toilets regularly. One thing we do about 2-3 times a year is flush either some baker's yeast. It is effectively the same thing as Rid-X and much cheaper. I've also heard flushing raw hamburger (small quantities) is another way to get the bacteria going, but I'm a little nervous about that idea. I figure my septic tank gets enough hamburger the "regular" way if you know what I mean.
Building code in Canada I completely agree that having more locks can be helpful but also keep in mind that the brand and model also play an important part. AFAIK, some locks (including deadbolts) are still susceptible to bump-key techniques. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. ;-) -M
Building code in Canada First, let me state that I am NOT a fan of laminate flooring. Laminate flooring comes in a wide variety of quality levels, from extremely poor to fairly good, but share a common trait. They are always a "picture" of wood on some pressed paper or synthetic backing. They can be miserable to work with, easily damaged and almost impossible to repair after installation. Consider an engineered wood "click lock" instead. Pricing is very close and the engineered products usually are much more stable due to having a solid plywood backing, and somewhat refinish-able with a true hardwood veneer. They also handle the occasional water spill much better than most laminates that usually swell, bubble and blister at the site of water! As to your question, strip flooring can be installed in any direction in any room, however the convention is to run parallel with the longest wall in most situations. Rarely is this type of flooring run perpendicular to walls in a hallway. Not only does it tend to make a hallway look narrower than it actually is, but can cause a lot of waste of material when installing. Don't be afraid of changing directions from the room to the hallway if your using a good wood product that can be cut cleanly on a table or chop saw. You simply need to make a very straight and slightly back angled edge (maybe 2 degrees) so the adjoining 90 degree slats are tight with no open gaps. This is extremely difficult to do with cheap laminate, but not so much with a good wood product. There are transition pieces available for both styles, but they usually involve a change of floor level like a threshold and are not a good idea to use on open flooring, as they can create a tripping hazard, however they are fine to use in doorways etc. If you really want to have different directions between spaces, consider using a darker color "frame" around the room. This can make a very attractive transition to a large hallway or separate use area in an open design. Another serious consideration is what type of flooring to use in a large high traffic area vs a smaller room. Laminates are almost always floating and will invariably sound hollow and creak as the temperature changes. For instances, walking across a cold laminate floor first thing in the morning can be like entering a haunted house at a fun park! Seriously investigate the advantages of a better quality engineered product.
Building code in Canada I am not a mason, but my guess is this will be difficult to do it well. My advice is even more suspect since I cannot see the stairs themselves and the extent of the problem. A thin veneer over some faces and a thick one in other places will chip and crack, especially if water ever gets in and freezes. But the major problem is the existing cracks. Those cracks may come from settling/frost heaves, etc. That will leave this new layer prone to the same problem. In order to prevent this, the new layer would need to be reinforced to strengthen it, and it would need to be thick enough to be able to resist cracking when one half of the stairs tries to move. Do these stairs rest on bare ground? Or do they have a proper foundation underneath to avoid frost heaves? My guess is the cracking suggests they are moving around with the weather. A poor fix that fails in a couple of years is worse than doing it right the first time. The best solution probably is to remove them and put new stairs in.
Building code in Canada I agree with all three of your points regarding the pinch ring. I chose to use the pinch ring style to modify some of the work that the previous owner did in our place and had no problems after over a year of them being in place.
Is there any legitimate reason you would NOT connect the ground wire on a circuit? I've been doing some remodeling on my house and had the need to move some electrical outlets. While doing so, I noticed that the ground wire wasn't hooked up on any of the outlets in the circuit (through a bathroom, no less). It was three wire cable, so the ground wire was there. It was just bent back or snipped off at each box and not connected to the outgoing ground line in any way. If it were 2-wire cable, I could chalk it up to someone being cheap, but I can't imagine someone being so lazy that they didn't connect the ground wires when they were right there and available. Most of the other circuits in the house seem correct, so maybe this is intentional? Does anyone know a legitimate reason you would wire up a circuit and not connect the ground wires?
Is there any legitimate reason you would NOT connect the ground wire on a circuit? This is Canada's National Building Code, but unfortunately they seem only to sell copies of it on CD or printed form.
How so I fix a loose Kwikset deadbolt faceplate? We have a kwikset deadbolt on our main door and the faceplate has come loose. There are no visible screws on either side of the door, so I am assuming they are under the brass plate on the inside of the door. I can't seem to get the plate off though. There is a little rectangle on the bottom of the plate, but it doesn't seem to help pop off the plate. The locking handle seems too close for the plate to be allowed to moved enough to reach screws anyway. Does anyone know how to get the plate off?
How so I fix a loose Kwikset deadbolt faceplate? No, there is no reason not to have the ground connected. Even with armored (BX) cable, you should connect the ground. There is an older style of armored cable that uses a wide metallic strip (inside) as the ground which is a bit flaky since it's hard to get a good connection (it is just supposed to connect with the box connector). The actual armor though is not designed for grounding, and should not be used or relied on as a ground (though in most cases, the electrical connection exists for it to work as ground). Let me be clear though -- you should check what is on the other side of the wire, and make sure it actually is grounded (or, possibly, not connected -- which you can fix), and that it is not being used for some other purpose. Just a red flag for me: when someone snips off the ground it means they didn't know what they were doing, so don't assume that anything is correct. One thing to look for - there should only be one common ground in your house, and everything should be tied together. If you have, for example, two separate ground rods and circuits mixed, you can have ground loops and noise issues, especially if you have sensitive electronics (TVs, amplifiers, computers) connected. All grounds should be connected together at or near the main panel. On the same topic, you should have a ground wire connecting your electrical grounding wire to all copper pipes in your house, and to any gas lines. Be careful with placement, as often you need a jumper wire to go around a non-conductive water meter to connect both sets of pipes together.
Understanding results of an energy audit We had an energy audit done a couple of years ago on our 20 year old home. Basically, they hooked up a blower to the front door, and tested the amount of air leakage. The written report suggested a number of improvements, most of which we did: new windows, doors, sealing attic hatches, etc. The total spent was around $15k. Because there's a local government plan to cover some of the expenses, we had a follow up audit done. The overall score from the follow up was exactly the same. This really baffles me, because I know in a couple of places (pre-repair) I could feel a breeze coming in, and the candle test showed it. Will I actually get any savings from my new, expensive, energy-star compliant doors & windows?
Understanding results of an energy audit Black spray paint?
How do I clean a very dirty refrigerator? I just got a new house and inherited a very moldy and mildewy refrigerator. My first though it to get some cleaning spray with bleach and just go to town, but I'm worried the bleach might damage the fridge in some way. It's close enough to an outside door that I could take it outside and hose it out as well. I'm wondering if others have had a similar situation and got good results with a particular set of cleaning products.
How do I clean a very dirty refrigerator? I've used bleach in the past but you have to rinse it out VERY well. Depending on where the fridge is (and if you can manage to get some friends to help you) you could take it out on the lawn or driveway, scrub the daylights out of it with bleach and water and then hose down the inside with the garden hose ... that way the mess is outside and you can spray to your hearts content without dirtying up the kitchen (or room where it's located).
How do I clean a very dirty refrigerator? I've cleaned minor mold and mildew with Windex, but if it's that bad, do you really want to store your food in it? Any harsh chemical cleaner may have a bad effect on any rubber/plastic seal, too, though using occasionally and not letting it sit minimizes the effect.
How do I clean a very dirty refrigerator? Two possibilities come to mind: The original contractor was negligent: the circuit is not grounded. This might either be because he was a criminal schmuck, or because he thought that GFI was somehow a substitute for grounding (which would explain why it's only in the bathrooms). You are using armored BX cable, the metal sheath of the BX cable is grounded, and it is electrically connected to the outlet box which is electrically connected to the ground lead so the outlet is really grounded I once came across a bunch of boxes like this (#2) in an old Manhattan brownstone. I couldn't find any ground leads at all, but when I plugged in an outlet tester, it did appear to be grounded, which surprised me. Then I realized the box itself was grounded via the sheath of the BX cable (which is exactly as it should be, to protect for the case of a loose connection inside the box) and that the receptacle itself will be grounded if the box is grounded. In fact even if you have a ground lead, it's good practice to connect it to the metal box with a pigtail.
How do I clean a very dirty refrigerator? Here's my 0.02: For starters, check with the refrigerator manufacturer for official cleaning instructions. Some have explicit cleaning instructions/restrictions. Try basic cleaning first (a good how-to is available here: http://www.ehow.com/how_92_clean-refrigerator.html). Assuming that doesn't do the trick, you can try bleach but be careful. Another good how-to is available here: http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2489239/how_to_clean_a_moldy_refrigerator.html -M
How do I clean a very dirty refrigerator? One web site recommends a combination of pressure washer, mineral spirit, and scrubbing with a wire brush.
What is the best way to clean toilet bowl stains? Bought a house a little over a year ago and it was previously a foreclosure and sat for a while. Because of that, it hadn't been cleaned for a while and developed some stains around the water line in all the toilets that we haven't been able to get off. Anyone have any tips on how to get rid of them? Rather unsightly and sure there must be a way to clean them off. Have tried some different tips I'd heard, like pouring a 20oz Coke in the toilet and let it sit over night... that didn't work.
What is the best way to clean toilet bowl stains? Have you tried CLR?
What is the best way to clean toilet bowl stains? The Kwikset locks I've replaced had screws on the deadbolt plate, but I've heard that others have a 'snap-on' plate that can be removed with a flathead screwdriver. This forum post seems to concern a case similar to yours.
What is the best way to clean toilet bowl stains? I agree with Jeff and Mike's answers, but you also have to make sure the lock was installed correctly. When I bought my house and changed the locks, I found out that the strike plates installed (deadbolt and doorknob) on the front door were only screwed into the trim with 1/4" screws. It wouldn't have taken much force at all to rip them right out. (My guess is one well-aimed kick.) The new Schlage locks that I bought came with 4" screws for mounting the deadbolt strike plate THROUGH the trim and into the studs behind the frame.
Is some asymmetry in a breaker box normal? What about neutral to ground having voltage? So, next in my quest to evaluate the health of my new home's electrical system, and call in professionals if needed, was some voltage checking of the panels/outlets around the house. What I have is a main 200A service in the basement, and a 100amp sub-panel on the main floor. See the attached schematic (notice the main panel has a bonding strap between neutral and ground, where as the sub panel does not- I believe this is the right way for it to be wired). I borrowed a friends Fluke multimeter and found the following- In both panels, the red bar to neutral is 119 volts, and the black bar to neutral is 121.5 volts (red and black in my diagram). Testing the outlets around upstairs, I noticed that, as expected, some have a delta v of 119, others, 121.5. I then tested the voltage drop across red to black, and found it to be around 242 volts. I also noticed that I have a slight voltage across my neutral to ground (it just so happens to be about 1.5 volts) upstairs. Is this kind of small asymmetry normal? Should I be getting an electrician in to check things out?
Why is my toilet constantly backing up? I've been in my new house for a few months now, and I end up plunging one of our two toilets about once a week - they tend to swap turns on which one gets to be finicky each week. Is there a more serious cause behind this, or do I just have 'crappy' (hehe) toilets? I don't know if it could be an issue with my septic system. The previous owners weren't too into home repair, so I have no idea if it's ever been pumped, but the house is only 7 years old. While I have managed to refine my plunging technique to an art, I'd appreciate any advice that will let me take a break.
Why is my toilet constantly backing up? From your description, I'd guess it is the toilets themselves. If it is the septic system, you would expect to see slow flowing drains/backup in all of the drains on the lowest floor of the house. If it is only one toilet that is experiencing this, I'd guess it is a cheapo low-power model installed by the builder. Do you have the brand/model and stats of the toilet?
Things to look for while entering the crawlspace of a house I'm considering buying? I'm going to examine the crawlspace under a house I'm considering buying. What type of things should I look for? Here's my list so far: Water, moisture, and dampness -- finding it's source. Electrical lines -- their type and condition. Foundation -- condition... cracks, signs of movement. Wood condition -- signs of termites, wood rot, decay. Anything else? Keep in mind that I'm a newbie. =) And yes, we're having professional inspections done too. -M
Things to look for while entering the crawlspace of a house I'm considering buying? It's probably the toilet that is the problem and nothing later in the line. I highly recommend the American Standard Champion4 Toilet. I installed this when I remodeled one of my bathrooms and two years later it has yet to clog (compared to the other two toilets in my house that clog on a regular basis). The advertisements show it being able to flush golf balls and although my kids have not tried that (at least not yet) I bet it really could handle it. You can find it at both Lowes and Home Depot.
Things to look for while entering the crawlspace of a house I'm considering buying? Surprisingly (to me, anyway) a pumice stone works great for this. A friend recommended it to me when I had a similar situation to yours. I had a hard time believing the stone wouldn't scratch the porcelain bowl, but it didn't and removed the rings pretty quickly.
Which kind of plaster to use on concrete walls, prior to painting? I have a small holiday apartment in Europe that has pre-fabricated concrete walls. The surfaces are relatively smooth but I want to prepare them for painting by applying a skim coat of plaster. Which kind of plaster is the most appropriate for this purpose. By the way, these are internal walls.
Which kind of plaster to use on concrete walls, prior to painting? Neutral-ground bonding The panels are wired correctly. There must only be one connection between neutral and ground in the main service panel. If a subpanel has a bond, then it puts the neutral in parallel with the ground wire back to the main panel -- and this means current from normal loads (that normally the neutral would carry) will travel on ground paths back to the main panel. This includes bare ground wires, conduits, and metal housings. If someone were to touch anything grounded, they could be electrocuted. This can also mean that the magnetic fields created in the hot and neutral don't cancel each other out, which can generate a lot of interference. In the worst case, bad connections or other faults can cause a voltage difference between ground and neutral, causing a lot of very difficult to diagnose problems, and making it even more likely to be electrocuted by touching something grounded (anywhere in the house, from any panel). In short: There must be only one bond between ground and neutral, and it goes in the main panel. Differences in voltage The differences in voltage between the two busses is fairly normal. It is likely caused by the transformer on the pole, or by a load in your house that is causing a voltage drop. For the latter you can try turning off circuits to see if it goes away, but for the former, you're pretty much SOL. That said, it's not a problem. Mains in North America is supposed to be 120V +/-5% (so 114 to 126V is acceptable). The voltage from neutral-ground is also normal. Here is a decent (but technical) article on neutral-ground voltage. In short, it's caused by the fact that over any length of wire, you have some drop in voltage. Since no current flows in the ground wire, there is no drop there and thus you have a difference in voltage. Another source is induced current, which can be caused by wires going through magnetic fields, such as near motors. In short, it doesn't sound like you have any problems.
Which kind of plaster to use on concrete walls, prior to painting? The benefits of the clamps are exactly as you say - the biggest one being that they're sometimes the only option in a cramped area. They used to be over 5x the price of the rings, which adds up very quickly -- but I see now they are only slightly more expensive. I don't think they're any less reliable than regular pex crimps, I know of some (at my cottage) that have been fine for 5+ years now.
Which kind of plaster to use on concrete walls, prior to painting? Is it possible to just seal the wall, prime it, and then paint (maybe using a thick nap roller) avoiding have to put down any plaster? After you have sealed and primed the wall, a coat (or two) of paint with a thick nap roller might be able to smooth out any small defects in the pre-fabricated wall. And painting is going to be much easier than putting plaster down. (Of course patch any major defects in the wall prior to sealing it.)
Is it necessary to connect a boiler and gas meter to the main fuse box? We are getting a new kitchen fitted. An electrical survey has been carried out by the compnay installing kitchen. they have said that, our brand new and recently fitted, boiler needs a earth wire running from itself to the fusebox. As does our old gas meter. This is a pain as they are at the outermost parts of our property and the fusebox is central. So it will mean cables/wires all over the place. Surely the boiler can be earthed via nearby mains powerpoint ? Or straight out to the literal earth via the nearby water stop cock/water meter. Any advice from electricians, or those with electrical knowledge ? I am based in the UK, and apparently these are health safety regulations, although I think they are somewhat open to interpretation.
Is it necessary to connect a boiler and gas meter to the main fuse box? Any top coat plaster should be OK. It might be worth priming the surface with a diluted PVA solution (5 parts water to 1 part PVA - from memory so double check) to seal it.
Is it necessary to connect a boiler and gas meter to the main fuse box? I know you're in the UK, but I'll answer for the US in case someone there has the same question. Boilers and furnaces must be powered by a separate, grounded circuit. Any metal piping system that is likely to become energized must be bonded, including gas pipes, but the equipment grounding conductor run with the circuit conductors feeding a gas appliance "shall be permitted to serve as the bonding means": NEC 250.104 (B) Other Metal Piping. Where installed in or attached to a building or structure, a metal piping system(s), including gas piping, that is likely to become energized shall be bonded to the service equipment enclosure, the grounded conductor at the service, the grounding electrode conductor where of sufficient size, or the one or more grounding electrodes used. The bonding jumper(s) shall be sized in accordance with 250.122, using the rating of the circuit that is likely to energize the piping system(s). The equipment grounding conductor for the circuit that is likely to energize the piping shall be permitted to serve as the bonding means. The points of attachment of the bonding jumper(s) shall be accessible.
Is it necessary to connect a boiler and gas meter to the main fuse box? I don't think you can earth via the water pipes any more, so that's not an option. I would have thought that the boiler would be earthed through it's normal power supply, but if it needs a separate earth then as for the meter you could run the earth wire around the outside of the house to the fuse box (or as far as possible) which would minimise both the disruption in installing it and the amount of wire you need.
Is it necessary to connect a boiler and gas meter to the main fuse box? Some things we found under our crawl space that you can keep an eye out for: Joist hangers weren't secured to code, not enough nails. Insulation wasn't properly secured and was sagging. If the crawlspace is part of an addition, make sure ducts and vents arn't coverd up and carry through to the exterior of the house. Make sure any vents aren't leaking air and flow is good.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? Circuit diagrams are very handy. On this site, they can really help illustrate the problem or solution (see here). They can help you visualize what needs to be changed when doing work on your house, and they keep a record of how your house is wired up. How can I easily create these diagrams, especially if I want a digital copy of them? What simple (hopefully free) programs do people use?
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? So to post a formal answer- The program I used to create the diagram in the linked post was Adobe Illustrator, which is definitely not free. That being said, any descent vector drawing program can easily make diagrams like these- one free one that comes to mind is InkScape. That combined with a good library of commonly used symbols in SVG format would make creating these diagrams much easier. I have been able to find plenty of typical electrical circuit symbols but have yet to find home wiring symbols. I have several that I have made, that I'd be happy to release if they would be useful. Edit- another program I have used in the past that is free is xfig, which is a simple vector drawing program for X11 systems. Works great on Linux or OS X, and it includes a pretty big library of schematic symbols.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? Keep in mind what the goal is. The goal is to have everything bonded to a common ground to avoid voltage differentials due to different ground potentials. Like others have said, older installations might use water pipes, but newer usually can't. I don't know your local code, but that's the goal that the code is pushing you towards.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? If you use a Mac, then OmniGraffle might work well. It has some basic symbols for circuit diagrams, and you can easily add new ones (e.g., by pasting in some that you find as images on web pages). It's about $100, but there is a 14-day free trial.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? The easiest solution is to draw on paper, then scan or photograph. Even cell phone cameras are usually sufficient. It may not look as professional, but you don't have to install diagramming software and learn to use it.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I use TurboCad. Prior versions are available from software discounters for as little as US$20. A Mac version is slightly less.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? when faced with a similar situation I was really paranoid and took two cookie sheets and cut a relief cut so I could put each sheet over the pipe in the opposite direction and then soldered the new shutoff valve in place and still be able to get the sheets off.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? If you have any unused piece of tin ventilation or flashing you can snip out a piece of that and set it behind the pipe. My dad used to do this because it was always readily available and easy to snip to whatever size you wanted.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? You also may be able to check out a lot of the plumbing while you're down there. I'm sure this isn't that common, but I've found a broken drain pipe (god knows how that happened), and two (so far) never-glued PVC connections in the crawlspace under our rental cottage. Also look for signs of leakage or deterioration.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I knew a few EE's who used TinyCAD for circuit diagrams. It might be a little bit of overkill for drawing simpler diagrams though. The best news is, it's FREE! Screenshot:
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I usually use a piece or two of aluminum flashing to sheild the areas behind the pipes. Its cheap, easily bent and dissipates heat well.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I use TinyCad - its free, open source and is very activily supported by users. http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinycad/
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I would suggest stainsolver
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I would do one direction, vertically in your drawing.
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? I'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet, but I've always heard it is better to install laminate flooring perpendicular to the floor joists in the room. Often the subfloor can be slightly unlevel due to high points running along the joists and low points halfway between the joists. If your laminate flooring is parallel to the joists, it will simply follow the dips and peaks of the subfloor. However, if it is perpendicular to the joists it will be more likely to span any dips and appear more level. So my advice is to lay the flooring perpendicular to the joists in the room and hallway, and if that means having it run in different directions for the two, just cover the space in between up with a transition strip in the doorway, like a t-moulding:
How can I create circuit diagrams and what program should I use? There are MANY ways to do this. You can buy a piece of heat resistant cloth made specifically for this purpose. You can use a piece of metal as a backing. In fact, this is what I do, since I've got a box full of scrap metal in the shop. Scrap aluminum flashing is especially good, since it is flexible and cheap. You can use compression fittings, so no heat produced at all. They are not cheap of course. I've even seen a tube of stuff that is essentially glue for copper pipe - you squeeze a bit on the joint, slip the pieces together and give them a quick twist, and in a few seconds it sets up. No heat required. Again, this stuff was not cheap, and if you solder only infrequently, the tube will probably dry up before you need to use it a second time. Finally, you can just be careful. Skill with a torch will keep the flame where it belongs - on the pipe, not on the wood behind it. Of course, until you have gained that skill, you might end up burning down your house.
Faucet spout perlator: worth it? I've seen the following perlator and similars (also plastic ones) on some shopping sites. They claim it can decrease water consumption up to 40%. Is it possible? Is it worth to try?
Faucet spout perlator: worth it? I've had a couple of these over the years and found that their biggest benefit was the ability to convert to a spray for better rinsing of dishes if your sink doesn't have a separate sprayer, not so much their water-saving ability. Even though a 40% reduction sounds like a lot, your kitchen sink doesn't use that much water to begin with compared to, say, your shower or clothes washer. So reducing your kitchen sink usage by 40% may not produce noticeable results on your water bill.
Faucet spout perlator: worth it? With a longer hallway I would also consider how square the hall is. If it is out a couple of inches over a long span, and you run the boards along the wall, one side of the hall is going to have boards that get thinner or wider. In this case I would personally run it across the hall. I'm a fan of running the boards separate directions in the living room to the hall. If that is your plan, I would start on the right wall of the large room and work to the left. This way you would make sure you have a full width board at the door entrance, and if there is a thinner board it is on the outside wall. Then you can butt your hall pieces up against it and run them the length of the hall. This assumes your hall is square.
Faucet spout perlator: worth it? If the circuit breaker goes in without having to pound it in, I would say that it is probably fine. There are circuit breakers that are designed to go into more than one type of panel. I know that Square D makes breakers that work in multiple breaker panels, including QP panels. As long as there isn't a significant voltage drop across the breaker, don't worry about it. I would go along and test the voltage drop across all of the breakers while you are at it. That might give you an early warning of a faulty breaker.
Faucet spout perlator: worth it? If you have a hot wire that has come loose that touches the gas pipe you want it to cause a short so that it trips the breaker, or blows a fuse. If the wire doesn't trip a breaker, or blows a fuse, the wire can start eating away at the pipe. I have actually seen an armored cable eat away at a piece of ductwork, all the wile giving off a glow where the two met.
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? I'm planning to remove a "popcorn" ceiling and submitted a ceiling sample to the labs for asbestos testing. Here are the results: It looks to me like the labs didn't detect any asbestos but I'm not sure what exactly Vermiculite is and if it's safe to remove myself. Any thoughts? Are there any special removal instructions for Vermiculite?
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? I'd recommend calling the company who did the testing and ask them for clarification. I'm not sure if the Vermiculite itself poses any health hazards. I did read that it's non-toxic but I'm not sure what happens when you disturb it to remove it. I think in this case it's probably best to ask the professionals.
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? Just use vinegar and water.
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? You can just use whichever bus is easier to get to in the main panel since they are wired together, either with a large wire, or they can be physically the same piece of metal. That being said, any electrician who take pride in their work will make sure that all of the neutrals run to one bus-bar, and the grounds the other. Also it makes it so that later down the line, you can add a new panel as the main one, using the old main panel as a sub-panel without a lot of rewiring.
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? On your bottom photo can you just put some screws in the back? For other vents do something similar? Or get out a handy tube of silicone or liquid nails and go crazy.
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? I have welded metal pipes, right next to wood, without starting a fire. Although I was just using the wood to hold the pipes where I wanted them while welding, so it didn't matter how damaged the wood became. Since we are talking about structural members of a building, you may want to do something to protect the wood. Just make sure you aren't pointing the torch directly at any flammables, and use something that is fire-resistant to deflect the heat, and you should be fine. You could even use a spray bottle before hand, to lightly spray nearby flammables to help deflect the heat. You can also go and check on it after a while, just to make sure nothing is going to catch fire.
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? Vermiculite on its own poses no health risk, and can be removed without concern. However, in many cases, mined vermiculite can contain traces of Asbestos, and so its removal is not recommended without an asbestos test. I would, as Scott suggests, call the testing company, and make sure that since no asbestos fibers were found, this indicates that the vermiculite used was asbestos free. If that is the case, you are good to go (that being said- wear a mask when you strip the popcorn ceilings, or you'll be coughing and hacking a lot- that dust is nasty).
Is the vermiculite found in my popcorn ceiling toxic? Can I remove it myself? After doing everything else to clean the hard surfaces, you might want to look to see if you can get a gasket replacement kit for your model of fridge -- sometimes, it's easier to replace softer parts than to try to clean them. (particularly if they're aged / cracked / torn / etc.) ... oh ... and don't use mouthwash. That was my brother's solution to trying to use to disinfect (after hosing out and scrubbing) a fridge in similar condition that I acquired ... everything tasted vaguely minty for months afterwards.
Can't remove ice tray from GE french door fridge I have a GE stainless french door fridge model GFSS6KKXSS. I can't get the ice maker tray to come out. It has a small release lever on the side, which I have used before when removing it. It seems to be frozen in there, or stuck on something. I want to take it out because it was jammed and the auger wouldn't turn. I blew into the ice depensing hole with a hair dryer and got it to turn again. It dispense the ice, but I need to get it out to see if anything is broken. Disclaimer: Not a photo of my actual fridge - stock photo used.
Can't remove ice tray from GE french door fridge I have a well as my water source, and my water has high levels of iron. This stains and leaves a residue in my sinks, shower, and toilets. It's from from the byproducts of the iron-eating bacteria. It's actually harmless, but it's smelly and ugly. If you're not sure what's in your water, you should take a water sample to get chemically tested. I found a state certified water lab in the yellow pages under "Chemical Consultants." Mostly cleaning the toilet just takes elbow grease, patience, and a willingness to work on a gross toilet for some time. I start by just scrubbing with a toilet brush, both in the bowl and in the tank. That gets rid of some of the loose buildup. Then I put on some long rubber cleaning gloves, get a fresh Scotch-Brite scrubbing pad (a used one is too soft to be effective), and I get started. I use Barkeeper's Friend, a dry acid-based cleanser. This helps to break down the stains. I shake about 1 tablespoon of Barkeeper's Friend onto the Scotch-Brite pad and scrub it into the stain. I mix Barkeeper's Friend with a small amount of water to make a thick paste and smear that liberally on tough stains. I let it sit for about a minute, and then the stain is a lot easier to scrub out. The cleaner is helpful in the upper bowl, but it's less effective below the water line as it just dilutes in water. I've tried liquid toilet bowl cleaner too, and that can help. Just make sure you don't mix acid-based cleaners with chlorine bleach! This produces poisonous chlorine gas. I think liquid toilet bowl cleaners are now made without acids for this reason, but check the ingredients carefully. And wear long cleaning gloves and eye protection.
Can't remove ice tray from GE french door fridge I have also found that buildup of minerals or iron by-product can foul up the mechanism that lets the float detect the water level. I have a lot of crud in my water because I'm on a well. Harmless, but smelly. So I have to take apart the toilet mechanism about every month or two and scrub it all out.
Is it an easy task to replace a wall thermostat? As above, is it an easy DIY job to do this safely? In my research into the above it has become apparant that I should consider replacing the old thermostat with a programmable one for energy savings. How does a programmable thermostat produce savings? I assumed the whole point of the thermostat in the first place was that the heating wouldn't be on if it was below the desired level anyway.
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? As above, the hot water works but the radiators do not come on. It's an old gas powered central heating system. We're thinking it's the wall thermostat at fault but is there anything else it might be? Update: I thought I should post a follow up for the sake of future Googlers. It turned out to be the pump as ChrisF had suggested. The hot water still worked because it's gravity fed from the loft (or attic if you prefer ;)), whereas the pump wasn't kicking in at all. 20 years' worth of use had clogged it up. When the system was emptied the water that came out of it started brown and quickly went black. With your car you get it serviced every year. Boilers get serviced on a regular basis too but the system itself doesn't, so over the years the muck builds up and builds up and nothing gets done about it causes something to break, i.e. now.
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? To answer the first question: Replacing the thermostat is equivalent to changing a light switch. You need to turn the power to the central heating off before you start work. Unscrew the old thermostat, disconnect and then reconnect the new one. What you will need to make sure before you do this is that the new thermostat has the same terminals as the old. Do you have a particular thermostat in mind? If so can you provide a link, then we'll be able answer the second question more easily.
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? The most obvious thing that springs to mind is that you have air in your system. Do the pipes between the radiators get hot, or the bottoms of the radiators but not the top? If so then you need to bleed your radiators. You should have a little key with a square hole. Carefully open the valve at the top of the radiator a very small amount - you should hear a hissing sound of air escaping. Wait until water starts to dribble out - use a cloth to catch this. Repeat for all radiators. For more information, pictures and a couple of videos see The Ultimate Handyman UPDATE Turn your thermostat all the way up - to make sure that it registers the current temperature as too cold - then the boiler should kick in. If not then it's the thermostat. If the boiler does kick in check the central heating return pipe - this should get hot after a few minutes. If not then there's either an airlock in the pipes themselves or the pump isn't working. Can you hear the pump turning. If not there's a screw head in the centre of the pump which controls the speed of the pump (see the pictures here). Turn this clockwise. If the pump still doesn't turn you may need to replace it. It could also be the electronics in the boiler not sending the signal out to the pump. At this point consulting a heating engineer would be your best option.
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? To lend support to ChrisF ... it's very easy to change your thermostat. Every place I've lived in has had the old mercury trip thermostat, wildly inaccurate. I just went to my local home depot and for about $25 I picked up a nice programmable digital thermostat. Was a snap to replace and works prefectly !!
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? Replacing a thermostat is trivial, and similar to changing a light switch. Disconnect the two wires coming from the furnace/boiler, then reconnect them to the new thermostat. Turn off power to the furnace/boiler first. A programmable thermostat saves fuel and money because it can be programmed to lower the temperature when you sleep or are at work. It doesn't matter which brand you pick, but most of them have horrible user interfaces, worse than old VCRs and clock radios.
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? There should be a valve in line with the pipe that goes to the radiator. They are usually right after a manifold (one in, many out). The thermostat controls those valves. You can feel the pips (carefully) to see if the hot water gets past the valve. You could also check the voltage to the valve coming from the thermostat. They are usually 24 volts AC to open them and let the hot water through. Be sure to put the voltmete on AC not DC.
Although my hot water works, why won't my radiator come on? DO NOT use a hair dryer in your fridge. I've seen it many times where people destroy the fridge because they get the plastic too hot and it will actually melt. If you have a big cooler, load it up with all of your stuff, turn the fridge off and leave the door open. This should melt any ice that is stuck there. If you leave the freezer closed and don't open it, don't worry about taking your stuff out of it. It'll stay cold for quite a while on it's own.
What is the difference between dimmable and non-dimmable CFL bulbs? I have a dimmable ceiling light fixture in the Dining room. I put in CFL bulbs a few months ago. It all seems to work fine, no problem. I went to a hardware store yesterday and saw that there were CFL bulbs that were labeled as "dimmable". They were ~$10 for a bulb that puts out light equivalent to 100 W incandescent bulb. What's the difference between a dimmable and a regular CFL bulb? Do I really need a dimmable one? My regular CFL bulb seems to work fine right now.
How long can I wait before staining a new deck? I just moved into a new (well, old) house. The previous owners put in a deck probably about 1 year ago. It's treated lumber, but they hadn't yet stained it. Winter is approaching quickly here in upstate NY, so I'd like to wait until Spring if I can. But I'm concerned that letting it sit unstained through the winter will have long term effects on the wood. So, can I wait? or should I do it?
How long can I wait before staining a new deck? It'll be fine. You should always wait at least one year anyways to make sure the wood is fully dried. I think I waited almost 3 years before I stained parts of my deck, with no detrimental effects.
How long can I wait before staining a new deck? Like other answers indicate, this is pretty simple, and a great idea if you're going from a manual to programmable thermostat. I can't comment yet, but thought it important to point out that there are (at least) two different types of thermostats. Some work for forced-air furnaces, and others work for radiators. Make sure you get the right kind.
Can oscillating "multi-tools" sand vertical surfaces? I need to sand some rough spots on our old front door before repainting and am considering buying/using a multi-tool for this task (as well as some tricky flooring and drywall tasks later). What's strange though, is that I haven't seen any demonstration videos where people are sanding a vertical surface. Do these tools require the surfaces to be flat and horizontal when sanding?
Can oscillating "multi-tools" sand vertical surfaces? That is odd, I've never noticed that but you're right! Anyway, they can sand, cut, or whatever else you want to do in any orientation. I've been thrilled with mine so far.
Can oscillating "multi-tools" sand vertical surfaces? If you're talking about tools like this, then you can use them vertically. The manual for the tool I linked to doesn't have any mention of the words horizontal, vertical, level, flat or upright, so if they don't warn you not to, you can assume it's OK to do it. One thing to note is that to sand a vertical surface, you're going to have to hold the tool more tightly than you would if you were working on a horizontal surface. This will cause more vibration to be transferred to your hand and wrists, which will tire them out more quickly. If you're doing a large area, this can cause repetitive strain injury; when I sanded some window frames a while back, it took a couple of days afterwards for my wrist to feel OK again.
Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket? I have a covered lampholder (light socket) outside my house that I want to use to temporarily power a plug-in string of indoor/outdoor lights. Using CFLs, the total wattage of the string of lights will be lower than the rated wattage (100 W) of the lampholder. The string of lights uses a grounded (three-prong) plug. Is there a way to safely power this using the lampholder? I can't find any lampholder-to-outlet adapters that give you a grounded outlet. Are there any? Would it be safe to use a two-prong lampholder-to-outlet adapter with a two- to three-prong grounding adapter? Is there anything I can do to make it safer? Keep in mind that this is outdoors, under small cover.
Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket? If you're talking about an A19 lampholder (the medium screw-in base widely used in the US), there are only two electrical contacts: live is at the back of the lampholder and neutral is the screw thread. While the light fixture itself should be grounded, it's not available via an adapter. In an outdoor situation, ground protection is even more important than indoors; if your exterior circuit also includes exterior receptacles, it should already be covered by a GFCI. As I said in an another answer, that breaks the circuit if there's a ground fault, but without a ground connection, any current is going through you to ground, instead of through the ground lead. So no, it's not safe to use a two-prong to three-prong adapter and leave the ground on your lights disconnected. I have seen exterior light fixtures with a grounded electrical outlet built into them; if you were able to change the light fixture, that would be the safest way to go.
Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket? Have you tried pulling up the toilet and seeing if there is an object stuck in trap (the S-shaped portion of the toilet)? I had a similar issue and someone had dropped a toothbrush into the toilet, which got lodged sideways into the drain area. I took off the floor bolts, detached the water source, pulled up the toilet, looked up the toilet drain pipe, and the problem was immediately evident. You might need to buy a new wax ring to reinstall the toilet onto the floor.
Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket? Would a bamboo rug work? It'd be easy to roll up when not in use. I don't know if it's a great dancing surface, though.
Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket? Here is an article (How to Make a Temporary Dance Floor) on how to make a dance floor from Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) and some old scrap carpeting. Home Depot also sells carpeting by the roll and it is pretty inexpensive (then you could get just the right size fit for the MDF boards and also the area of your dance floor). Purchase MDF and scrap carpet at a hardware store specific to your measurements. Standard MDF will be 3/4 inch thick and will be cut into 4 feet by 8 feet pieces. You should have the MDF cut into pieces that will fit easily into your space. Purchase the same amount of scrap carpet to place underneath the MDF. Glue the scrap carpet to the underside of the MDF. This will prevent your floor from being scratched and will provide cushioning for your feet and knees.
Can I safely power a three-prong electrical device from a light socket? Remember that ground can save lives. I do not live in the US, but in my country the rules for ground are very strict. If you can connect the ground you have to do. And you are not allowed to have grounded and ungrounded equipment in the same room. But reality often differs... I have jusd replaced and expanded the electricity in our house. In the shed anything was grounded but the ground wire was not attached. So I did attach the wire. Some days later (during the housewarming party) we saw a flash and heard a loud bang. After some investigation I found out that there was an loose (life) wire that connected with the metal (now grounded) case which resulted in a nice and spectacular short circuit. This means, that If I hadn't connected the ground, the metal case of the light was connected to 230 V AC unnoticed. Anybody could have touched that with probably fatal results. So I'm really glad I have the habit to examine and correct all electrical connections.
What's the best/official way to draw a building's electrical system? We are installing home automation systems, and we have serious problems with electricians. Short: they are stupid and lazy. So, we have to do something. There're some stories: We have a spreadsheet with a numbered list of all the wallets, lamps, switches, and also a layout map of the house, all wallets/lamps/buttons/etc. signed on it with these ID numbers. With this list in his hand, our electrician just marked all wires with his own words instead of numbers, e.g. "sleeping room lamp switch". He has made no checklist at all. We're working at the rack, wiring relays. There are cca. 200 wires coming from the rooms for input/outputs installed by electrician, but after a while we found that about 50 wires are missing, there are plenty of relays left empty. We call electrician, he says: "I have had no more space for wires". (Not my story.) We mark all swith places on the wall with small sticky papers, writing ID numbers on it. Checking wires, it appears that there is a wire numbered "4" at the place "14". Electrician says "oh, I did not see the '1' before the '4'...". And so on. Electricians don't do any documentation. The pen and paper is missing from electricians' toolbox. We're enough. Legendary hard times arrives for electricians. We will don't pay if they don't do their job immaculate (we will ask customers to do so). Sorry, guys. So, what we need is a simple, easy-to-understand graphical markup system which we can push into the hands of the electrician, and say: that's the job, brother, do it, no more, no else, no less, otherwise you will be surprised at payment. Is there any standard for it? We should draw it into the layout plan. We should put separate rooms to separate pages, if it helps. Any ideas are welcome, e.g. "make two drawings, one for wallets and another for lamps", "use only prime numbers for IDs", "don't draw, use detailed textual instruction list with checkboxes", "ask him to sign that he understands the plan and the conditions" etc. The drawing system should contain the following item types: pushbutton, shutter pushbutton (two-way, 3 wires: common + up/dn), wallet 220V, IR/move sensor, shutter motor (3 wires), lamp 220V, wallet 220V, CAT5 ethernet cable (both for computer network and buttons), other power wire (e.g. 12V), etc. (I will update the question if you have other important requirements I forgot.)
What's the best/official way to draw a building's electrical system? Don't assign any complex function to IRL buttons. They sould just turn on and off the device, set the temperature higher or lower, max. select mode. Just as if there were no home aut. at all. The complex functions should be reach only from computer interface. There are room for "online" help, more complex widgets (e.g. time adjust) etc.
What's the best/official way to draw a building's electrical system? I have the harbor freight version, and it has served me well, but I would definitely recommend the upgrade to one of the more mainstream versions. I've been through 3 so far, all warranty replacements, for switch failures. Even with the failures, I've been very happy with the job that the tool did and will definitely upgrade to a Fein if and when we purchase the fixer upper house we are looking for.
What are some tips for installing a small shed? I want to put in a small shed to store my push lawn mower and perhaps a few other things. Our village's website states we need a permit: SHEDS – Must be either anchored to a concrete slab or have footers 42” deep Inspections Required for Sheds: Footers (prior to pouring concrete) rough framing and a final inspection. Which is easier/cheaper? concrete slab or footers? How do I go about buying a shed? Would I need to do the concrete/footers myself and then have home depot deliver it? We live in upstate NY if that matters (lots of snow in the winter).
What are some tips for installing a small shed? Any place that sells pre-built sheds in your area would likely have advice on site preparation for delivery. I don't know what the soil's like in your area, but if you're going to hit bedrock before 42", it'd likely be easier to put in a slab; If you're likely to hit lots of tree-roots, the slab might be a better choice (so you don't kill a tree, and have it fall on your new shed) For most other times, I'd personally go with footings, but I live in an area that's clay and easy to dig. (other than tree roots). Some pre-built sheds are made to sit on a slab, as they have no floor; this can make it easier to get things in/out of the shed, as you don't have the step-up. ... also, rather than buying from Home Depot or similar, look to see if there are Amish or Menonite areas near you -- they often have businesses that do this sort of pre-built structure construction. It might be a little more expensive, but you can get them customized to a specific size, material, etc ... it's what I'd do if I wasn't going to build it myself.
Can plants be planted over a drain field? The previous owner of my house planted plants and small bushes where the drain field is. I have a feeling that the roots will eventually damage the drains. Is this okay or should I remove them?
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? I have a pile of drywall scrap that's been sitting in my garage for a few years after a remodel, "just in case". My buddy came up with the idea of turning it into "karate boards" for our kids to destroy. Scrap pieces start at half sheet (4x4) and go down. I'm also on the lookout for an excuse to buy something new. (Honey, it's for the kids!) At this point my only idea is to use the circular saw and toss the blade afterwards.
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? A craft knife or box cutter will do the job very quickly and cheaply. You only need to score the front side of the drywall and then it should snap cleanly enough along the score line. If you already have a Dremel or Roto-Zip, you can get drywall bits for them that will make short work of any drywall.
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? I'll go ahead and answer because I think your core question is a good one. It sounds like what your company installs are fairly complex home automation systems, and you're hiring residential electricians to do the wiring. Instead, what you need for applications like this is an electrician with industrial automation experience. They do exactly the type of thing you're asking all day long -- wiring rack-mounted PLCs and relays, labeling wires according to ID numbers on a diagram, high voltage and low voltage wiring and termination. Another thing you need is a contract. If having your circuits and wires marked a certain way is important to you, then you need to specify that in your contract. You can't just assume that your electrician will know that you prefer ID numbers on your circuits just because he has a sheet with ID numbers on it, especially a residential electrician whose usual clients would have no idea what the ID numbers meant. And then, if something isn't done according to what you spelled out in the contract, you can point it out and the electrician will correct it. The other stories you mention just sound like mistakes that should have been corrected by the electrician, assuming they were his error (was it you or he that ordered the relay panel that didn't have enough room for 200 wires?). Anyway, everyone makes mistakes now and then. To answer your specific question, there already is a system for diagramming electrical circuits. You should probably already be familiar with these symbols if you're installing home automation. One last piece of advice for good communication with your electrician if you're working in the U.S. (which you may not be): make sure that what you're calling these devices matches up with U.S. terminology for these devices. For example, in the US, you would never call a switch with an "up" and "down" position a pushbutton. Here, a pushbutton is a button that you push into the surface on which it's mounted. Up/down switches are normally just called switches, at least in a house. I don't know what a wallet is, maybe a wall outlet? And it would be very unusual to have a 220V lamp circuit.
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? Niall's right with the craft knife -- just score, snap, and cut the paper on the other side. The rotozip and similar work fine, when it's just quick a dirty, unless it's really intricate cuts, I stick with a good old drywall saw. You can get cheap ones for $3-5.
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? There is always a drywall saw. It can be messy (not as clean as a knife) but it works fast.
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? If you're really on the lookout to buy something new, a sawzall would make extremely quick work of this task. It's like using a sledgehammer to kill a fly, but they're really handy in other areas, and you can pick one up for less than $100. The rotozip suggestion is also a good one.
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? You have an excuse to buy a tool? Why not go for broke: US-X Computerized Cross-Cut Saw
What quick and dirty tool/method should I use for cutting scrap drywall? Do not use a non-dimmable CFL with a dimmer. It shortens the CFL's life, and, in rare cases, a dimmer operating a CFL could result in fire. Change it out with a switch to be safe. Dimmable CFLs aren't as good as incandescent for dimming. Their lowest settings are nowhere near that of incandescent, but they are good if you want the option to save on power and still be able to dim the lighting. Sometimes you will have to turn up the light to get it to kick on and then dim it. They can also be audible at their lowest setting. If you buy some, save the receipt as you may not like their drawbacks.
How can I seal around a light fixture/light switch outlet? I Have a house built in 1972. I'm currently 80% finished in installing a ceiling fan into my master bedroom. I had an energy audit about a month ago, which revealed that I had "pretty good sealing" in my home, but found the classic attic/wall entry points, specifically, wall outlets and holes in the ceiling for light fixtures, were leaking air. I've already bought and installed all of the foam outlet/switch sealers (like this), but I don't feel as though its sealing very well around the house. I'm also not sure what to do around the hole in the ceiling. Googling reveals suggestions like this one, but doesnt specifically mention what can be done to seal a hole in the drywall around electrical fixtures (I'm concerned about fires) Any suggestions?
How do I repair spots of damaged hardwood floor finish? I have some hardwood floors that I refinished 5 years or so ago. They're mostly holding up pretty well, but around our breakfast bar the stools have taken up some of the varathane and have left damaged (scuffed and peeling) spots. Are there products and/or tools that I can use to repair those spots without substantial sanding, and without refinishing the whole floor?
How do I repair spots of damaged hardwood floor finish? If the gap is small enough, you can just use some general purpose caulk. For bigger gaps, patch it with some mud or spackle, then caulk to finish. Since it's going to be hidden behind a light fixture, it doesn't even have to be that pretty! (They do make a fire-retardant foam, but I look at the warning labels and get nervous when they say "extremely flammable while curing.“)
How do I cut nice mitered corners? I will be adding moulding and trim to a few rooms after I lay laminate flooring. I have already done this in one room and I was really discouraged with my miter cuts. In most corners, I had a gap of at least 1/4" that I had to fill with caulk even though I set my compound miter saw to 45 degrees. Does anyone have any advice on cutting better corners?
How do I cut nice mitered corners? There are two possible causes for this: Your room's corners aren't exactly 90°. Your mitre saw isn't accurate. Given you mention you are using a compound mitre saw I'm going to go with the former. Unfortunately with non-square rooms you're going to have to do this by a little bit of trial and error. Use some offcuts of the moulding or even scrap wood to find the exact angles you need and then transfer those to the actual pieces of wood you are going to use.
How do I cut nice mitered corners? Are you cutting with the board standing up in the saw like it will be positioned in the room, or with the board laying flat in the saw and using the compound setting to cut it? The reason I mention it is that I once borrowed a saw and it just wasn't as accurate using the compound setting (saw tilted). Swinging the saw left or right, there is usually a detent at 45 degrees and the saw is more accurate. If you board is too wide, you may have no choice other than lay it flat and use the compound feature. Brian
How do I get the stem out of a hose bib to replace the washer? I have no idea why this isn't simple, perhaps because every repair project has to have some hitch in it to piss me off. I have a leaky hose bib in my back yard, so I wanted to take the sucker apart and replace the washer in the valve stem, right? Well, I took the screw out, the one in the middle of the handle. Then I unscrewed the hex around the stem, but the sucker just won't come loose. It shakes around and wobbles like it should come off, but it just doesn't. I thought maybe I needed to unscrew the handle out of there once I got the screw and nut off, but wound up just breaking off part of the handle. So now I am buying a new hose bib anyway to replace the one I broke, but I am still curious, how the heck do I get that sucker off? For reference, the hose bib is the style pictured here.
What's the easiest process for cutting bathroom flooring tiles to fit complex door trim? I'm going to be laying in some fairly heavy-duty vinyl bathroom flooring tiles (similar to the Armstrong Caliber product, although I'm not sure it's actually that brand). The bathroom has some tough corners to match, which I will cover with molding, but also has some places where the doorway trim goes through the floor, and so I have to try to trim to the profile of the trim. Are there any good ways to do this (short of removing the trim and sing it as a template)? With lighter-weight linoleum I would probably just use a box-cutter to try to make the cuts - is there a better tool to use for this material?
What's the easiest process for cutting bathroom flooring tiles to fit complex door trim? You can use Kicad - open source and very activily supported by users.
What's the easiest process for cutting bathroom flooring tiles to fit complex door trim? I would cut the bottom of the trim so the tile can slide underneath. Then you only need to approximate the shape of the tile, but you don't have to worry about perfect edges. I've used the Dremel Multi-Max with the 3/4" flush cut blade to cut base trim and door jambs so I could slide hardwood flooring underneath. I borrowed a friend's and decided I needed to buy my own as soon as my next project came up.
What's the easiest process for cutting bathroom flooring tiles to fit complex door trim? I agree with aphoria about cutting under the trim. The best tool for this is a dovetail saw. Lay your vinyl next to the door, place the saw flat on top, create yourself a nice snug pocket to slide the flooring under. As far as cutting the vinyl, you can use a heat gun to soften the material first to make an easier/cleaner cut with your utility knife.
What is the best way to remove and prevent leaf stains on concrete pavers? We have a brand new paver stone walkway/patio. To my dismay, I noticed that their were leaf and acorn stains from the oak tree in the front yard. I've learned my lesson and I'm going to try to keep the walkway swept more regularly. Will these stains go away with enough rain & time? If not, what's the best remedy for removing these stains? What's the best mode of prevention?
What is the best way to remove and prevent leaf stains on concrete pavers? I'd agree with @aphoria about just cutting back the trim (unless this is a temporary job, as you're not going to be able to extend it later if the floor gets lowered). ... but I wouldn't use a dovetail saw. Yes, the fine teeth will minimize tearing, but the handle placement and rigid spine make it much more difficult to get a horizontal cut. Instead, try a "ryoba" (japanese pull saw) ... the flexible blade means you get it right against where you're trying to cut.
What is the best way to remove and prevent leaf stains on concrete pavers? (I need to do one of these myself in the next couple of days.) As I recall, you would follow this procedure... Turn off the water, so no pressure is found at the valve itself. Remove the handle, by unscrewing the small screw in the center. Be careful not to damage the phillips head recess, as this screw is probably made of brass. Remove the small nut around the stem. Put the handle back on. This part is only temporary, to allow you to unscrew the stem itself. If the stem will not pull out, you need to pull out the packing around the stem. That packing prevents water from escaping past the stem when the water is turned on. You may need a needle nose pliers to pull the packing out. Once the packing is removed, the stem should unscrew easily. Do so. Verify that you have the correct size washer, and put the new one in. Again, be careful with that screw as it is often made of a soft metal. If you damage the head, replace it too. (If the water has been dripping for too long, the seat for the valve can actually be eroded. So look inside for signs of this. There are tools you can use to repair a valve seat, but it might just be better to replace a valve that is badly damaged.) Screw the stem back in. Replace the packing. New packing can be bought from your local hardware store, and it is a good idea to replace it now. It is basically cord, impregnated with graphite or teflon, that will compact under pressure from the nut. Put the packing nut back on, not too tight that the stem will not turn, but not too loose that water comes out when the pressure is back on. Either of these problems are easily identified and resolved of course. Put back the handle in its proper place, tighten down the screw carefully. Turn the water back on. Check for leaks. I think I got the major steps down.
What is the best way to remove and prevent leaf stains on concrete pavers? The tannins from oak leaves will leave stains behind. I would suggest not worrying about it. Those stains are just character, part of nature. Choose to appreciate nature. You could probably bleach them out (using simple chlorine bleach or oxalic acid), but why? Why introduce harmful chemicals into the area that may hurt you or damage your plants? Besides, the bleach may not get everything consistently the same color as it was. So you may just leave yourself with another problem to solve. Sunlight will cause them to fade over time anyway, and as other stains occur, the pavers will become randomly stained, eventually all to the same color.
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? We have a glass cooker hob (glass top stove) where the black glass has chipped at one edge. Is there a repair system that will hide the damage? I am looking for something that is gloss block that will stick on the glass, so as to hide the chips. This is what I mean by a "cooker hob"
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? Firstly if the circuit is protected with a RCD (residual-current device) you have a lot less to be concerned about. I would not be very happy having a string of lights not protected by a RCD however they are connected! The next step is to find out if the earth pin on the lights plug does anything. There may be only a two core cable from the plug to the lights, or the earth core of the cable may not connect to anything in the lights. If this is the case you don’t need an earth. If you do need an earth (ground), you have to be careful about which earth you use. Depending on where you live you are not allowed to connect outside equipment to the house earth and must put in a separate earth spike. Otherwise if you get a fault in the house, you can export the fault voltage to the case of the outdoor equipment. If I were you, I would buy a set of low voltage lights, or failing that a set of “double insulated” lights so you don’t need to think about earthing.
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? Another option would be to replace the basic lampholder with a lampholder that has a grounded outlet in its base. They fit on the same hole size, and this would give you the grounding that you are looking for as well. Of course, you will need a ground wire already run to the lampholder (which may or may not already be there).
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? Keep in mind that for inside corners, you shouldn't be using miter cuts at all -- you should cope them instead. That gives you a joint that appears mitered, but is more forgiving of slight errors and with less tendency to open up over time.
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? You could try an oxygen bleach like StainSolver. Its not harmful to the environment. I don't have any association with it other than being a customer.
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? This apparently is for a smooth glass top on a stove. GE sells them, perhaps others now. Traditionally, the word is that these are generally replaced when cracked. A small chip on the edge may not be worth replacing the top (which is EXPENSIVE from what I've heard) until that crack chooses to propagate. The problem is, heat stresses in glass tend to turn small cracks into big ones. You might ask the manufacturer, but I'll bet a large sum of money they have no interest in repair anyway. They want to sell you a new top. The first solution I would think of is a high temperature silicon caulk. You can buy it in a tube, and it does come in black. I don't know how much it hardens though. If not that, I would look for a high temperature epoxy. You can get colorants for epoxy.
How do I repair a glass cooker hob (glass top stove)? You could use a profile gauge. They are also known as contour gauges. You push this against your architrave (the doorway trim) and you get the profile you need to cut. You then transfer this to what ever you are cutting (the vinyl in this case) by drawing round the shape. You then use a sharp knife to cut along the line. The Wikipedia entry has a couple of nice pictures to show how it can be used. I've also found this clip from MichaelHoligan.com which shows one in use.
Is there an alternative and less toxic way to clean an oven than using oven spray? I have drippings that have caked on to the botton surface of my oven. Now, every time we use the oven, they start to smoke and set off the smoke detector. What are some natural ways to clean the oven? There's probably some major scrubbing in my future. :)
Is there an alternative and less toxic way to clean an oven than using oven spray? If you have a self cleaning oven you can use that cycle. It heats the oven up to a very high temperature (600-700 degrees I believe) for about 5 hours which basically burns away anything that's caked on the inside.
Is it possible to patch a crack in a toilet? We have a medicine cabinet placed above the toilet. Not the best place but not a lot of choice. Anyway, while fumbling for some Sudafed in the dark, I managed to knock a cough mixture bottle out of the cabinet. CRACK Takes a chunk about three inches long one wide out of the rim of the bowl, and I think caused a crack down the side as well. EDIT: definite cracks on the outside, can feel a slightly raised edge. So, I know we need a new toilet but it will be awhile till we can sort one. Is there anything I can patch it with in the meantime. As it's the only toilet in the house. EDIT: One thought was to duct tape the side,would hope that could a least hold it together for a little while.
Is it possible to patch a crack in a toilet? Create a mixture of water, vinegar and a spash of lemon juice (for smell only) in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture on the dirty surfaces in the oven.- Sprinkle baking soda over the mixture. Begin scrubbing these areas with a very fine steel wool until the areas are clean. Wipe out the oven with a dry towel. Wet a sponge and go over the areas again to get all the remaining vinegar and baking soda out of the oven. You might try asking this question on the cooking stackexchange as well, as I'm sure they would have some good answers.
Is it possible to patch a crack in a toilet? I used a product called Bar Keepers Friend on mine. All I needed to do was scrub.
Is it possible to patch a crack in a toilet? I'd try a marine grade epoxy (loctite makes such a product) to just seal the crack for a short time. If you still have the chunk that was broken off the marine grade epoxy should work but it's probably not going to look pretty. I've used it before and it mixes up to a rather ugly dark gray/black color and dries the same, but if you can live with the color difference it is VERY strong and waterproof. I used it to seal a leaky PVC pipe for a number of days until I had the time to fix it properly and not a drop of water came out. EDIT: Found a link to the product here
Is it possible to patch a crack in a toilet? If it's only chipped, and not actually a crack forming, I'd think that you'd be able to just add a little bit of trim over the very edge. The glass doesn't tend to get too hot over on the sides, but there'd be a good chance of taking a hot pan, and it coming into contact, so you'd want something that could take heat (so not most plastics). It's possible that they'd sell it at home improvement type stores ... I hate that little gap between my stove and my counter, as something always falls in there and you have to go fish it out. If it's started cracking, I'd actually think about getting one of those glue & vaccuum kits they use for repairing car windshields, where you use a vacuum to try to force the glue into the crack, let it cure, and then scrape off any surface residue. I'm guessing they use CA glue (cyanoacrylate, aka "super glue"), but I don't know how thick -- the thicker ones have a longer cure time, but they won't penetrate as well due to capillary action. You'd want to check to make sure that it's a CA mix that's rated for use on glass. (pure CAs don't stick well to glass)
Is it possible to patch a crack in a toilet? Simple Green often works. Spray it on full strength and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then scrub. Repeat as necessary.
Should I use thread-seal tape for steam pipe? I am getting ready to replace the pressuretrol of my oil-burning steam boiler, which provides heat and hot water. Should I use thread-seal tape (aka. Teflon tape, PTFE tape, tape dope, or plumber's tape) when attaching the new pressuretrol? If so, should I use the same kind of tape that I use for water pipes, or is there a special kind for use with steam pipes? (The pressuretrol datasheet describes the connector as “1/4 inch female pipe thread.” I presume that is a synonym for national pipe thread taperered thread (NPT), so the threads themselves are providing the seal, and there is no gasket.)
How do I run new water lines from the basement to the second floor through a finished wall? I am redoing an upstairs bathroom that has galvanized steel pipes currently running to it for water supply that run straight up from the basement. I am debating between using PEX or copper for the new supply lines. From what I have researched, if i use PEX, it will slap against the wall of the 1st floor since i cannot attach braces inside the finished wall without removing drywall. Is this true? Also, if I do use copper, what size is recommended for a bathroom: 1/2" or 3/4"? What type of braces does copper need to support it? I am planning on bracing it in the basement and at the 2nd floor where it enters.
How do I run new water lines from the basement to the second floor through a finished wall? My favorite pipe thread sealer is RectorSeal #5. Here's a link. I see according to its datasheet that its rated for steam pipes. You might have to let it dry a little while before pressuring, but after that its good for 2600 psi.
How do I run new water lines from the basement to the second floor through a finished wall? It really depends on what you want to plant, but generally you do not want to have anything but grass or something that has shallow roots and does not block out the sun. Your leech field works in two ways, one is the water leeches through the soil, but the other way that it works is evaporation. Evaporation accounts from 30 to 70% of what goes in your leech field, depending on how it is designed. So I would avoid putting to much around it or over it. Trees will love the water, but eventually clog up your field. The worst, ficus trees, they should be called ficus weeds.
Why is my refrigerator so loud? Can I fix this? I live in a small NYC apartment and my refrigerator is close to the bedroom. When it kicks on, it's makes a loud thunk/click, and can be enough to wake me up. (While running it's pretty quiet.) I think it's the fan in the freezer. The maintenance folks have replaced it once or twice, but it seems not to change. Anything I can do? (FWIW, it's Whirlpool.)
Why is my refrigerator so loud? Can I fix this? Here's an outside the box idea (which assumes that your main problem is that it wakes you up): Get one of those timer plugs like they have for holiday lights and let it "unplug" your fridge while you sleep. You'll need a beefy one to handle the compressor spike when it kicks on (check the ratings on the timer plugs and compare it to the max rating of your fridge). Since the fridge door won't be opened, your food should be fine, though I'd test it the first night to be sure with a fridge thermometer. If your fridge is still cold in the morning, you might have a solution!
Cable Signal Testers I'm looking for tools that can help me test the signal coming into my house from my cable provider. I am currently having issues with a Leviton CATV Relay which I'll replace, but I've been having issues with the cable modem since I took it offline. I now realized, after reading the manual on Leviton's site, that the relay is actually a two way amplifier, which I presume could have previously been affecting the signal coming into the modem, and the modem was probably calibrated to handle it as it was. Anyway, that's neither here nor there, I'm hoping once the relay is replaced it will normalize the modem, but I still would like to know what tools I can get to test the stability of the signals coming in (or being relayed out).
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? In about 2 weeks I'm doing a little cathartic destruction of a deck on the back of my house. The deck came with the house and has suffered YEARS of neglect, it's beyond repair, built incorrectly, and looks awful so OUT it goes !! My problem is: Whoever built the deck bolted a 2x6 into the siding of the house to act as a joist for the floorboards. When I remove the 2x6 I'll have a few bolt sized holes in my siding. Winter is fast approaching and the last thing I need is snow getting into the holes, melting, refreezing and causing untold havoc on the interior. My question is: What is the best way to fill in the holes in the Aluminum siding? I don't have any spare siding laying around so I can't replace the damaged pieces so I need to plug them somehow.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? Do you have (or can you acquire) any pieces of aluminium or other non ferrous metal at all? If so you could cut small squares that will fit over the holes, screw them over the hole using self tapping screws and seal round the edges of the patch. Painting would give it an extra layer of protection. It might not look particularly pretty, but will do the job until you are able to replace the affected pieces. Alternatively, some sort of mastic filler might work, but you'd have to check it adhered to aluminium otherwise it would just fall out. However, I think this would look worse than a patch.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? Copper pipe should be self supporting for the height of a room as long as you clip it as close to the floor/ceiling as possible, but if you've got particularly high rooms or high pressure you still might get some banging. There are various types of pipe clip you can get, some screw into the wall others nail, you just need a suitable anchor point. 1/2" (15mm) pipe should be adequate for most purposes, but I'd go with the size closest to the current pipes. Bath taps (in the UK at least) usually have larger diameter (3/4") to basin taps (1/2"), so you might want to use 3/4" (22mm) pipe if you've got a large bath.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? If your going to go with copper I would run a 3/4" trunk line up the wall, and then drop down to 1/2" to the fixtures. As for bracing the pipe you could use pipe clamps like this or this Just make sure the clamps are copper, if you mix metals you could risk corrosion and eventual leaks. You'll want to clamp the pipe as close as you can to where it enters and exits the first floor wall, though you may still get banging in the wall where there are no fasteners. As much as you may want to avoid it, it might be better to open up the wall on the first floor and clamp which ever type of pipe you decide to use properly. It might be a headache now, but just imagine the headache when every time somebody flushes you hear the pipes bang (especially at 3 AM in your bedroom wall).
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? You can use your cable modem itself as the tool. Do a search for "[your modem manufacturer] cable modem diagnostics" and you'll find out how to access the modem's diagnostic page in a web browser. This will give you upstream & downstream signal levels and lots of other useful info. Here's a page with some information about a few different manufacturers.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? I'm repairing my asphalt driveway currently. I have lots of cracks that grow weeds through. I tried to get it sealed with liquid sealant, but within a couple of months it was clear that this didn't work, because many new weeds have grown through the sealant. I think the workers who did the sealing did a really poor job, and I regret hiring them. Since then, I've read several DIY articles about it and I've started fixing the cracks myself. Here's what I'm doing: Clean driveway. I used a stiff broom, and even my shop-vac right over the cracks. Clear out the cracks. Remove weeds, dirt, debris. Scrape the crack out with a prybar. Clean again with a garden hose on "jet" setting. Let dry. Fill the cracks with asphalt filler. This comes in tubes like caulk, and I use a caulking gun to apply it. I use a cheap putty knife to smooth the top of the caulk. It's messy stuff, and I need to clean my tools with a powerful solvent. I use Gunk, an engine de-greaser. Once I have all the cracks repaired with caulk, I plan to re-seal the driveway again with liquid sealant. I agree with @Scott Vercuski, wear clothes you plan to throw out. I saw the workers using a pushbroom to spread the liquid, so I recommend getting a pushbroom you plan to use only for this project. I also have a couple of spots where a crack has let water seep in and erode a cavity beneath the asphalt. I'm going to have to chip out a section of asphalt with a hammer and chisel and restore it with with asphalt patch. This might be what you have to do with your low spot.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? Repair the cracks. If water gets in, you will not stop it from causing more cracks from freeze/thaw cycles. Next, use a better quality sealer. Messy stuff, but it will help. The problem with a low spot is something you cannot solve with a sealer or crack filler though. A low spot may mean that cars parked on the driveway have caused settling. (It seems silly to say that parking your car on your driveway is a bad thing, but what else can I say? If you really want a perfect driveway, don't use it.) Dips where your tires sit suggest that the base for the driveway was not sufficiently thick, or inadequately compacted, and over the years has sagged. If this is so, then water will continue to collect in the dips, and cause future problems until you choose to have a new driveway done.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? It doesn't sound like your case, but ensure the unit is level. If it is out of level, leaning components can make some sounds louder...
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? I'm afraid any stand alone meters are going to be pricey. There are two types to measure RF signal level. One that you set on a frequency and read the power level at that frequency. The other is called a spectrum analyzer and shows a waveform of the power level across a range of requencies. That is what is really needed to see whats going on. I'd try to get by with cable modem as suggested above.
What is the best way to fill in the holes in aluminum siding? I have the same thing on my driveway. A good power washer can remove the stains. Once cleaned, use a concrete sealer to seal the pavers and that should take care of it.
Can I use an 8" dado blade set in a 10" table saw? I have a 10" table saw... this is probably a stupid question, but can I use an 8" dado blade set in this saw? Is one only supposed to use 10" blades in a 10-inch saw? I read on some contractor's blog that one should only use saw blades that are within the range of blade sizes acceptable for a particular table saw (per that saw's documentation)... but for the life of me I wasn't able to find mention of the range of allowable blade sizes for this saw last night in reading the manual.
Can I use an 8" dado blade set in a 10" table saw? For what it's worth I've used a 6" stacked dado set in my small 10" saw for years without any issues. My understanding is that dado blades should always be smaller than the saw's rated blade size due to the increased load of cutting a wide dado over just cutting a saw kerf width. The smaller diameter means your saw will be able to exert more force on the teeth than it would with a larger diameter blade. Are you sure the blog you saw wasn't referring to not using blades that are larger than the saw's rated size? I could see issues with that but I'm not sure what the problem might be with using a smaller blade.
Can I use an 8" dado blade set in a 10" table saw? There is NO problem with using an 8 inch dado blade on a 10 inch saw. In fact, it is quite common to do so. I use an 8 inch stack on my Delta contractor's saw with no problems, and before that, I used an 8 inch wobble dado. You certainly would not want to use a 12 inch blade on a 10 inch saw, as that large of a blade might have clearance problems as it is adjusted. Use of a larger blade also causes somewhat larger tip speeds, so that might potentially cause problems. (Unlikely, but possible, since the differential in tip speed would be only 20%.) Perhaps these issues are what the author meant when they made that statement. In going to a smaller blade diameter though, the only question is whether that blade will be able to reach the surface of your table. On an 8 inch blade there is no problem.
Can I use an 8" dado blade set in a 10" table saw? Are you sure there is no exemption for non-permanent structures so you can avoid the inspection, etc. Many places have exemptions for 100 square feet or smaller. Really it depends if you are going to do other things in the shed, but if it were me I would just do the sonotube things. 42" is a long way though. You must be way up north.
Anyone heard of painting asbestos insulation tubes? We recently had an old furnace inspected and the heating specialist mentioned that he suspected that the heating ducts had asbestos. He suggested painting them as an alternative to expensive removal costs. I'm skeptical. Has anyone heard of this before? If so, what paint would be useful for this type of application? -M
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? We recently had our septic system inspected and were informed that the tanks themselves were shot and would need to be replaced. I'm in the process of getting estimates but in the meantime, I was wondering if someone could describe the procedure and ballpark costs. I assume we're talking about several thousands of dollars. Additional Information: House is located in Aptos, CA House is located on a mostly flat lot (9000 sq ft) and is elevated up from street. Front-yard is small and that's where the current septic tank is located. House is 48 years old Existing septic tank is concrete and 2250 gallons (according to inspections). Still waiting to complete details in report.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? I have to say that I have had two good ones. The first was with the wiring of all of my Cable TV Drops, after searching for almost an hour the tech finally found that 6 of my 8 cable drops were controlled by a pair of splitters, hidden behind a blank wall plate in my MASTER BEDROOM closet. No labeling, it was a total nightmare to straighten out, finally ended up paying a contractor to centralize and label everything for future use. In a previous house the previous owner finished the basement, but thought that 2X4"s were over rrated, so they finished the entire thing with 1X2"s with no vapor barriers, it was a VERY bad situation. To run wiring they simply ran the wire behind the 1X2 studs
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? Yes. I have heard of that. I believe the main issue with asbestos is when it becomes dust and floats in the air and is inhaled into the lungs. Painting over that seals it in and prevents that from happening. It probably should be repainted whenever it starts to show wear. You will probably need to use a government certified painter who will use special equipment to prevent the process from filling the air with particulates. (You'll have to check with your local government agency for exact requirements.) Asbestos is a very regulated substance. The EPA's website has an Asbestos Page that covers the topic from a concerned homeowner's point of view with links and advice: How To Manage An Asbestos Problem If the asbestos material is in good shape and will not be disturbed, do nothing! If it is a problem, there are two types of corrections: repair and removal. Repair usually involves either sealing or covering asbestos material. Sealing (encapsulation) involves treating the material with a sealant that either binds the asbestos fibers together or coats the material so fibers are not released. Pipe, furnace and boiler insulation can sometimes be repaired this way. This should be done only by a professional trained to handle asbestos safely. Covering (enclosure) involves placing something over or around the material that contains asbestos to prevent release of fibers. Exposed insulated piping may be covered with a protective wrap or jacket. With any type of repair, the asbestos remains in place. Repair is usually cheaper than removal, but it may make later removal of asbestos, if necessary, more difficult and costly. Repairs can either be major or minor. That page includes a section on "Asbestos Professionals: Who Are They and What Can They Do?". Also, farther down the page, under the heading "If You Hire A Corrective-Action Contractor" (I'm assuming your painting contractor would fall under this heading.): Contact your state and local health departments, EPA regional office, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regional office to find out what the regulations are. Be sure the contractor follows local asbestos removal and disposal laws. At the end of the job, get written assurance from the contractor that all procedures have been followed. You should put removal of that onto your "someday list" because that will come up as a negative if you ever want to sell your house.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? I have heard of this as an option, and even the EPA recommends it as a remediation process, BUT only if completed by a licensed contractor.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? The liquid aeration didn't appear to do much. Part of it is the moderate drought my area of the country is in. I am going to have the lawn mechanically aerated in a couple of weeks, so the experiment is over.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? I found some rough estimates at costhelper.com Installing/replacing a conventional septic system (including the tank) averages $2,000 -$5,000 in the Midwest, but can be $4,000 -$12,000 or more in areas where materials and labor rates are higher. Enhanced, engineered or alternative septic systems that use mounds, sand/peat filters, aerobic systems and/or constructed wetlands can cost $10,000 -$20,000 or more, according to the Rhode Island Regional Water Quality Program. These alternative septic systems work better than the conventional approach for sites with high groundwater or slowly/rapidly percolating soil, or near drinking water supplies, wetlands, coastal ponds or other water resources. The cost of a septic tank alone runs about $500 -$1,800 depending on size (ranging from 300-1,000 gallons) and type. Piping and other needed items adds another $100 -$200 to the total cost of materials.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? My basement was installed backwards (seriously). It's a split level house and the opening to the garage was supposed to be in the back of the house. This is because the ground slopes down from the road to the house in the front. I'm told by my neighbor (who was here when the house was built) that the contractor accidentally poured the concrete for the basement 180 degrees backward. This put the opening to the garage on the front of the house, and since the ground slopes down to it, my garage floods every time it rains.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? When I was a kid, my parents bought a 1936 Dutch Colonial home from an antisocial, reclusive, retired guy. Wall-to-wall forest green carpet and matching green velvet drapes made the interior as dark as a tomb, and outside the windows a line of pine trees and yew trees blocked all natural light. The guy owned two huge dogs, and every carpet and drapery reeked of... pet stains. As soon as you entered the house, you'd be bowled over by the smell. Our first task after moving in was to tear out all the carpet and drapes. We found that the oak hardwood floors underneath literally had water damage from the years of letting the dogs urinate inside the house. We had to have the floors throughout the whole house refinished. We also found scores of empty bottles of scotch stashed away inside the walls and floors in the basement.
About how much would replacing a septic tank cost me? Cheap cork tiles ...over every inch of the walls and roof ...of the toilet. And various old dildos in the roof, under the fence, etc, etc. (We replaced the kitchen, bathroom, floors and some drywall. Then we repainted all the interior walls and ceilings)
How do I make a height adjustable desk? Has anyone made their own height adjustable desk? I'm interested in making a computer desk that can easily be adjusted for either standing or sitting. The lift mechanism could be electric or mechanical, as long as it is not too hard or time-consuming to adjust. (There are commercial options around, but they start at $700 for the cheapest of the cheap. I'm sure I could make something myself for less that would better suit my needs.) Update: Just to answer some of the questions in the comments. The desk would be supporting two 22" LCD monitors, a laptop, paper and anything I leave lying around the house long enough for her to throw on my desk. :-) I do have access to some welding expertise. Also, I live in Australia so importing from many of the places suggested would be impractical.
How do I make a height adjustable desk? I think the biggest thing with the "push button" legs would be the ease of the ability to raise/lower the legs evenly when there's a load on them. The "push button" legs might be a bit tough, I.E. you push the button in and the leg shoots down because it's now free and there's a load on it and it pinches your finger or snaps down to the next level, not to mention you'd be raising one leg at a time and you'd have the added trouble of the load on the desk potentially being on a slope for a bit while you adjust the other legs. Hydraulics with a locking mechanism (similar to a car hoist) would be a nice choice but you'll probably pay through the teeth for something like that and I'm not sure if they make something like that in a smaller size.
How do I make a height adjustable desk? This is just my opinion, but I think you might be hard pressed to build one cheaper than you can buy one. If you're just looking for a project, it might be a challenging one. But if you're looking to save money building your own, I don't think you will. If you own your own fabrication shop and have lots of scrap to use then this might be an interesting build, but for the average DIYer I would say it's cheaper to buy then to build in this case. If I was going to build one I would probably use a Scissor Jack for inspiration. Another idea would be to use electric Linear Actuators and a telescoping tube system in the legs to lift the top. You could potentially use the pistons from some old office chairs, but you would have to make sure the desk top had enough weight to compress them (otherwise you would have to lean on the desk to make it go down). You would also have to physically lift the top to the desired height, which depending on the weight could potentially be a problem. You may also run into trouble engaging the lift/lower mechanism of all the pistons simultaneously. I came across this product which in itself would not be a solution, but the mechanism for lifting it could potentially be adapted to suit your needs.
How do I make a height adjustable desk? My current 1927 bungalow is chock full of atrocities. They really, really, loved telephones. There were 3 large telephone lines running to the house, tons of bundled up cable all over the side yard and in the attic, and phone jacks in every room of the house, including the bathrooms and dining room. They even had a phone line running out to the detached garage by the pool, and there was a phone jack inside the garage, as well as outside the garage for the "pool phone". Not necessarily a nightmare, but definitely a pain in the you-know-what when remodeling. They also decided to destroy the bathroom tile floor and fill it with concrete then cover with ugly pink-purple tile, without fixing the termite-eaten and rotten subfloor, so tiles were loose and cracking when I went in to re-tile, had to completely remove the floor (I was standing on the ground below the crawl space between floor joists), and rebuild the joists, subfloor, and floor. The toilet drain was loose, so wastewater had been seeping into the plywood subfloor for years, such that when I got around to replacing it, merely lightly touching the subfloor caused it to crumble. I'm amazed no one fell through the floor while on the john! And, of course, the usual stories of bad wiring, poor plumbing, and doing things on the cheap.
How do I make a height adjustable desk? I bet you could eliminate a lot of the engineering and fabrication work in making something like this by making a desk that has only two positions, standing and sitting, vs. trying to make one that's continuously adjustable anywhere between its highest and lowest setting. I'm thinking of something using a four-bar linkage on each end of the desk to keep the work surface flat while you move it from one position to the other, with pins to keep it secured in either position. You'd also want to incorporate some form of torque member to make sure the two linkages rotate together, to eliminate the need to always lift in the left-to-right center of the desk. Something like a closet rod might work for this. If you wanted, you could adjust your linkage geometry so that in the standing position the surface had a slight tilt, but was flat in the sitting position. Of course you'd be limited in how much stuff you could put on the desk because you'd be moving it by hand and not by electricity. You could use a counterweight in your linkage to offset some of the weight.
How do I make a height adjustable desk? I don't even know where to start. My home (a log cabin built by the previous owner) is a veritable shop of horrors. Some of the highlights. 1) One day I was leaning into a door by holding on to the piece of trim above the doorway. It came right off in my hand. It wasn't nailed or glued into place, just balanced on the vertical pieces of trim on the sides of the door. 2) The light switch boxes were apparently installed as a result of very little planning. They are too close to the door opening so that a notch is cut out of the trim around the door to accommodate putting the switch plate covers on them. 3) Many of the electrical circuits aren't grounded. It's not that there isn't a ground wire, it just isn't attached to the outlets/switches in the circuit. For some reason they are just cut off as they enter each box. 4) Scariest one - There was an ungrounded and obviously no GFI circuit than ran right next to an above ground pool. If the wall of that pool had leaked or collapsed that would have been an electro-fest. 5) Rigid Satillo tile installed right over the junction of two foundations (that weren't tied together). I'm sure you can guess why I know EXACTLY where those foundations meet. 6) A wire running along the outside of the wall and joined with electrical tape (no box) mid circuit. I didn't notice it until the water heater (right next to this) started leaking right onto that splice. Very scary. 7) The heat pump is installed in a small closet just so that to replace the filter I have to twist it considerably to fit it through the opening, usually mangling it. 8) Tons of trees planted way too close to each other in the yard. Now they are large mature trees that look like they are wrestling. 8) The plumbing in my well-house is unnecessarily haphhazzard. It is a made of stepping over and ducking under pipes just to get to the water softener, which I have to do carrying 40lb bags of salt. 9) The drain for the tub (clawfoot) is set right in the middle of where the tub goes instead of at the end where it belongs. It took some creative plumbing to make that work. The first plumber I called needed to escalate it to a more experienced guy from his company. 10) The electrical line from the main breaker to a workshop in the yard was strung across the yard like a clothesline. Had to be careful not to choke myself on it when mowing. I've fixed several of these and continue to do so as my budget permits. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that the previous owner was such a cheapskate he would regularly underpay people who came out to my house to do work or intentionally nitpick their work in an effort to negotiate them down AFTER they finished the job. Several repair guys I've called had to be convinced I there was a new owner before they would come out.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? I would like to install a new hose bib on the exterior wall of my house, to be accessed on the deck. Currently, there is a hose bib on the lower level (underneath the deck) straight down from where I would like to put this new one. Is there a risk of a pipe this length freezing in the winter, if it is in the middle of the insulated exterior wall? Should I use extra pipe insulation to prevent it from freezing, or with it being in a wall with insulation be enough? I'm in Virginia, so it doesnt get that cold, but it does freeze.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? Are you able to turn off the water supply to the lower faucet? And is this what you would normally do in cold weather? If so, you could turn off the water, open both faucets and the water in the pipe would drain out the lower faucet. You would be in exactly the same position as you were before in terms of freezing.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? A popular form of compost that is easy to apply is alfalfa compost. It comes in pellets that you can spread with any typical lawn spreader for fertilizer. Avoid using commercial fertilizers as they become like drugs for your lawn - the lawn will not grow without the fertilizer. Build up the lawn with compost, mulched leaves in the fall and mulched clippings. You may have to add some topsoil back into your lawn, but keep in mind that sellers are allowed to sell topsoil full of weed seeds. If you add some topsoil to your lawn, the next year you may find your lawn is full of weeds!
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? Geekdesk.com does sell just the frame of their desk, which knocks a good bit off the price AND the shipping, possibly making that a good starting point for such a project. ergodepot.com does the same (with many more frame styles), but they are more expensive.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? Been thinking about this all day and I came up with two ideas, both less than desk-like to keep the costs down. Simple tabletop mounted to rails on the wall. Lots of options for mechanical lift (scissor jack was my first idea, but I'd probably play with something hydraulic for fun). The rails would work like they do on a shelving system. You'd have to keep all the weight on the back edge though, probably not safe-enough for my house. If you're mostly doing computer stuff, mount a monitor to the wall on an arm and use an adjustable keyboard tray on a normal desk. I'm also thinking you could DIY the keyboard tray as a small-scale project before moving up.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? Use a frost-proof sillcock. It will shut off the water 12 inches into the wall (which is probably on the inside of the wall for you), and the water on the outside of the shutoff will drain as long as there is no hose attached.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? Admittedly, I haven't done it before but I came across instructions awhile ago (courtesy of eHow and Google). Maybe they'll be helpful. http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-fix-a-broken-tub-trip-lever http://www.ehow.com/how_3391064_replace-triplever-bathtub-drain.html -M
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? EMT (electrical metal tubing) is your best bet for outdoor cabling and it is also designed to be pliable for directional installation. You can buy a pipe bender that will allow you to angle it in any direction to make creating your path easy. EMT is what I've used in office buildings, retail stores and central offices and various other environments for running many types of cables in. EMT is strong for concrete and since it is designed for electrical, it is fairly waterproof, but there are other options like liquid-tight, that you can use along some portions that are completely waterproof.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? I love Japanese saws. They cut on the pull stroke and leaves a very narrow kerf (the channel that it cuts). I find that it cuts through wood a lot easier. Cutting on the pull stroke means that the blade won't bend. For saws that cut on the push stroke (most western saws), the blade might bend as you push. I have this all purpose one, Japanese Modern Ryoba Saw, at home. One side is for ripping (cutting to a certain width) the other is for cross cutting (cutting to a certain length)
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? You'll definitely need a torpedo level. I don't have a lot of storage space, so I just have one of these torpedo levels.
Can I run a copper pipe for water in an exterior wall without it freezing in the winter? A straight edge is really important. I actually have a 48" long aluminum ruler/straight edge that has a significant depth. It's great for drawing long lines and I sometimes use it as a guide for a circular saw or router.
Glass rod joining/welding: temperature instead of glueing? I have some glass things to fix ("decorative kitchen stuff to play with"). The broken part is a rod, about 8mm diameter, made of some colored glass. I thought of using nichrome wire, but seems that it can't hot enough to melt the glass. Should I try to connect the broken things with the butane torch lighter? Some ideas: make it look ugly, and ugly-repaired. Do not let parts disconnect again at their own will. No dynamic forces would be applied. ...forget about it. build RepRap and reproduce the thing. profit.
Glass rod joining/welding: temperature instead of glueing? I doubt this will work. For starters, from what I can see online, depending on what is in it, glass melts somewhere between 2700 and 4200 degrees F (1500-2300 °C). Butane burns at a temperature of 788°F (420°C). You also mentioned nichrome wire - but this too simply will not generate sufficient heat. Nichrome itself melts at 2552°F (1400°C), so it would not be able to transfer sufficient heat to glass without itself melting. Even if you could heat glass up enough to melt it, thermal stresses can be significant. So you may find that the glass shatters if you did heat it sufficiently. Those craftspeople who do work with glass also have torches and furnaces that are capable of significantly more heat than you can get from any simply source that a handyman can provide. Just use glue, perhaps a decent two part epoxy to join these pieces together.
Exterior lighting: Is a round waterproof lampholder ACTUALLY compatible with a rectangular housing? I happened to be at Home Depot for something else, so I didn't get a good look at our exterior floodlights that need to be replaced (they're about 13 years old and don't work anymore). So I picked up two of these, just to have 'em in case they were a good fit: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N5FF/ref=asc_df_B00002N5FF1260862?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=pg-894-10-20&linkCode=asn&creative=395093&creativeASIN=B00002N5FF But when I came home I saw that the boxes on my house are rectangular and not round like the lights I bought. I was planning to just exchange them for the right kind, but then I noticed that in the description on that Amazon listing, it says they work for round OR rectangular waterproof housings! So... what gives? Can I actually expect to mount the round lights on the rectangular hole and have 'em work? Seems too good to be true.
How do I make a manhole? I have a 100+ year old house with wooden floors. At the moment, access to the subfloor is difficult, involving a long 25 meter crawl under the deck. I'd like to install a manhole in the floor. Is this difficult?
How do I make a manhole? There are several issues here to deal with that I see. First, you need to find an appropriate location for this aperture. It is best if the location is one that you can get to easily, but out of the way - since a hole in the floor might be unsightly or something to trip over. It also needs to be accessible from below to get in and out. I would suggest a back hallway or back bedroom as being good. Second, you need to worry about which joists are involved. Can you get through a hole between the joists in your house? If you needed to cut through a supporting beam, this can have very serious and negative consequences on the structure of your house. Do NOT do that without knowing what and where you are cutting, and providing the necessary support for anything that is cut. You will need to carefully mark out the cut lines. Careful measurements will be important. You may choose to make a tiny hole or two with a small drill bit to figure exactly where you will cut relative to any joists. Last, the actual work. Cutting through the floorboards, once they are carefully marked, requires no more than use of a handheld circular saw or a reciprocating saw. There are several other types of saw that could do such a cut on the market, rotory "zip" tools for example, even a hand held manual saw if your skills were adequate. If you needed to cut a beam, then you will need to provide new support points for that joist on either side of the cut that are FULLY capable of carrying the load. You may even need to reinforce the floor boards themselves as they were cut on either side too. To close it all up, take the flooring that you cut out, and create a door from the flooring itself that matches the hole you just cut out. Recognize that this will be a trip point, so do not put a big, bulky handle on it. A simple, low piece of moulding around the perimeter may be sufficient to hide the cuts and support the "door". Even that is a trip point, so be careful here. All in all, this MAY be something that is best given to a reputable contractor to solve for you if you don't know how to solve the problems that will arise. The cost would depend upon whether you can find a location that does not require the cutting of any beams.
Testing a transformer I have a Comfort home control system. This takes 15V AC via a transformer (from 240V). It's been working for years, but last week the fuse blew. It's a 250mA fuse on the mains side of the transformer. With power off I checked the impedance on the 240V side of the transformer and it shows about 80 Ohms. Is that too low? By my reckoning that would mean 3A, which would blow the fuse. I'm guessing that insulation in the windings could have broken down and caused a short. Does this sound reasonable or am I misunderstanding how the transformer works?
Do I need to put mortar between wood and backerboard on a mixed wood/tile floor? We have a hardwood insert on our kitchen floor and we will be surrounding it with slate tile. Also the room next to the kitchen is all hardwood floor. Our heights are correct for the tile (with the backboard installed) but i'm curious as do I put down thin-set mortar between the backerboard and wood and then grout between the tile and wood as well? It seems like I should but I haven't found much information on tile/wood combinations. edit: picture! +++ #### wood and tile +++ ---- wood and backerboard ======== sub-floor So to clarify, do I need to put mortar between the wood and backerboard?
How do I clean an AC condensate pan? I have a Ducane HVAC system that started leaking out of the evaporator coil housing. Mine looks like the EU1P. I read that i need to clean out the drip pan. II tried cleaning it by sucking out the buildup with a wet/dry vac and flushing it with bleach solution but it's still leaking out of the back side that I can't get to. I've heard of people hosing it out, but that seems like it might make a mess and get things wet that maybe shouldn't be. I've also heard of people blowing it with compressed air but i thought that might just blow the stuff around only for it to clog up the system again. What should i do to get this thing to stop leaking?
What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing? I'm considering a new roof for my suburban home. The home is about fourteen years old and the shingles are in so-so shape. We have had two leaks already and I've been told that means it is a good time to consider replacing the roof. Rather than replace with another traditional shingle roof, I'm considering going with a metal roof. I've seen a couple in the neighborhood and they look nice, and I hear a metal roof will last a lot longer. Aluminum and steel appear to be the two major products when it comes to metal roofing for residential homes. I'm not sure whether I should be considering aluminum, or steel. What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing? That is, what advantages and disadvantages does steel roofing have compared to aluminum roofing, and vice-versa? If I go for one or the other type, what should I be looking out for and what should I be avoiding?
What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing? Not directly answering your question - but as you're replacing shingles with metal you'll need to make sure you insulate the roof well. Otherwise it could get very hot in summer and cold in winter.
What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing? The product description on Amazon is pulled directly from the manufacturer's data sheet (the link is an excerpt from a catalog, scroll down two pages for the light fixtures you bought), so I think you can trust it. Another assurance that you'll be OK: I see from that catalog that the base of the light fixture is 4 1/8" in diameter, which is the same as the outside dimension of the diagonal of a single gang box (at least the one I picked out of my big box of electrical goodies :). When you open the packaging, you should see a rectangular pattern in the molding on the back where the electrical box will be mounted.
What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing? Your understanding of transformers is a bit off, but the root cause may be as you suspected... A transformer (usually) consists of two coils of wire, a primary and a secondary, wrapped around a ferromagnetic core. An AC voltage applied to one coil creates a changing magnetic field in the core, which induces another AC voltage in the other coil. The ratio of the primary voltage to the secondary voltage is determined by the ratio of the number of turns in each coil (the turns ratio). When AC is applied, the impedance across the primary coil is that of the load circuit multiplied by the square of the turns ratio. An ohmmeter applies a known DC voltage to the circuit being tested and measures the current flowing into the circuit. Because it's DC, the magnetic field in the core doesn't change, so there's no voltage induced in the secondary coil. What you are measuring is simply the resistance of the primary coil, which should be low. Barring some unusual circumstance like an electrical storm causing a surge or a teenage son turning everything up to 11, you probably have a problem somewhere in your system. I think I would call in the service people at this point (I'm not familiar with your system, so don't know if it can be serviced by end-users), but if you're up to troubleshooting, and if you can disconnect or turn off everything on the secondary side of the transformer, you could try replacing the fuse and re-applying power. If the fuse blows again, you know it's the transformer at fault. If not, reconnect or turn on devices one-by-one until the problem manifests again.
What are the pros and cons of steel vs. aluminum metal roofing? If you want to make a non-traditional desk you could have four posts fashioned together into a frame that goes high in the air. You could then "hang" the desk using an easily adjustable pulley system to raise or lower the desk. The surface could then be on a track system to keep it secure. There would be plenty of caveats but something like this could work if you put enough thought into the design.
What happens when a vapor barrier is too close to the cold side? The vapour barrier must be installed on the warm side of the wall, that is on this interior side of the house. It is permissible to have it sandwiched in the middle between two layers of insulation, but only if the cold side insulating layer is at least two thirds thicker than the warm (source). My question is what happens, exactly, if the barrier is actually on the colder side? e.g. two-thirds warm insulation, barrier, one third cold insulation? This is in a very cold climate (-40 in winter not unusual). And what can be done to mitigate this situation?
What happens when a vapor barrier is too close to the cold side? Water could condense on the inside of the vapor barrier, which is what you don't want to happen.
What happens when a vapor barrier is too close to the cold side? You put the vapor barrier on the inside of insulation to prevent cold air from getting near the vapor barrier. If warm, humid air is touching a cold surface, the water will condense out, just like you see on a glass of ice water on a hot, humid day. This condensation is a bad thing, since the presence of water over a long period of time will cause mold to grow. The moisture may reduce the effectiveness of your insulation. It may cause dry rot in your home. It may cause other problems, attracting bugs who like moist places. How can you fix this? Turning the insulation to lie in the proper orientation is clearly the best solution. I suppose one could put an additional layer of vapor barrier on the inside. That will stop the inside, moisture laden air from getting to that middle layer. The problem is, this will create a layer of insulation that does not breath. Any moisture in there will never escape, and you will have the same problems as I mentioned above. So this could potentially be a bad solution. Better seems to add more insulation to the outside, with NO vapor barrier on it. That will prevent the cold air from getting near the vapor barrier. It may not be possible, or even terribly easy. But this is why you try to do things the right way the first time.
What happens when a vapor barrier is too close to the cold side? The aluminum is probably more susceptible to denting, being a softer metal. Will you ever need to walk on the roof? Do you have overhanging trees that may drop branches in a storm? Even trees near your house can see branches go flying your way. Another question is the coating used. Since steel can rust, you don't want to worry about it. A high quality product would seem valuable there. Of course, you don't want to see paint flakes peeling off an aluminum roofing product either. Finally, make sure that you can deal with snow, although this is not a factor that depends on the material itself. Our neighbor has a metal roof. A few years ago, we had a large, heavy snow fall, and a huge mass of snow broke free to slide off the roof. As it was coming down, it tore off the gutters on their home, then completely flattened part of their porch. My guess is it was several thousand dollars worth of damage. Falling snow can also damage plantings near the house. There are tabs that can be placed on the roof surface to prevent this if you live in the snow belt.
What happens when a vapor barrier is too close to the cold side? What you want is a MAPP torch. Many plumbers use it instead of propane for sweating copper because its hotter flame temperature gets the copper up to temperature more quickly. I have this one and the trigger start is very handy. For glass work you'd want to come up with something to clamp the torch in place on your bench, leaving both hands free to work. Here's a torch that mounts straight to your table for glass work, along with lots of other related accessories.
What happens when a vapor barrier is too close to the cold side? I had the same issue recently on my HVAC as well. You probably have a PVC pipe running from the bottom of the evaporator coil housing. The blockage is probably in there somewhere. You can disconnect the PVC and let the condensate drain into a bucket. If it does drain cleanly into a bucket, your blockage is in that drain line. Either snake it out or replace it. For me, snaking a 3/4 inch PVC with several 90-degree bends was more difficult than buying a couple pieces and replacing the drain line with 45-degree bends that are less prone to becoming blocked. I filtered the condensate where my new drain discharges into my sump with a paper towel and was shocked how much debris was being flushed out.
Can you cap a chimney to reduce moisture and still use the chimney with a gas fire? Or does capping a chimney always remove the ability to use a fire ?
Can you cap a chimney to reduce moisture and still use the chimney with a gas fire? This really depends on location. Locally estimates are in the 50K-100K range to go from design to installation.
Can you cap a chimney to reduce moisture and still use the chimney with a gas fire? I'm pretty sure that you can get caps that allow you to still use a gas fire. Consult an expert though.
How can I measure water/moisture content within a wall cavity? Related to improper placement of a vapour barrier within wall insulation, are there any tools or methods for measuring water/moisture content within a wall cavity?
How can I measure water/moisture content within a wall cavity? You might be able to use a moisture meter like this one, but you'd probably have to push completely through the drywall into the wall cavity. I've never used a moisture meter but the writeup states the following: The mini-Ligno S/D gives instant, accurate moisture readings between 6-45%, indicated by a bright digital read out. Designed for inspectors, architects, contractors, painters and homeowners. This meter is a useful tool to measure moisture content in wood and soft building materials such as drywall, plaster and gypsum. Features include a green cap that serves as a handle for easy probe insertion and covers the pins during transportation. Longer pins stored inside the meter for measuring thicker material. To obtain readings the pins are pushed into the wood and the unique on-off switch between the pins turns the meter on. I'm not certain it would work if you pushed it all the way through the drywall into the cavity. You might want to see if a local tool rental place has one you can rent before you sink the money into one for a one time reading.
How can I measure water/moisture content within a wall cavity? Yes, you can, but definately consult an expert like ChrisF stated. I would start with a fireplace and chimney store. I once made a cap that covered the flat space on top of the chimney and then had a raised center with a roof and screen to keep out rain and birds.
What are my options to level out my air conditioner? The air conditioner on the side of my house is on a small slab of concrete. Over time, it has started to tilt as the land has settled. We just recently moved in and a few of the neighbors have givens us advice, almost all of which is different. What options do I have other than paying someone to remove the unit and re-lay a new foundation for it?
What are my options to level out my air conditioner? I've used a moisture meter to do roughly this. My meter is the pinless kind. Some years ago, we had a contractor who did a less than perfect job on a bathroom remodel. (Ok, they left behind leaks in something like six separate places.) With the meter, I was able to tell where water was a problem, and also know when we had finally gotten all the leaks repaired. I would not expect the actual meter reading to be highly accurate, since these meters are usually calibrated for wood. But the meter will indeed be able to tell the presence of moisture, and to differentiate between dry and wet. The problem is, these meters can only read to a certain depth, typically a half inch or so in wood. I'll look tomorrow to see, I might be able to test mine under similar conditions to see how deeply it can read. Edit: I tested my moisture meter. I have a 12+ year old Wagner L609, an inexpensive pin-less meter that works nicely for wood samples. It is not tremendously accurate, but it does show moisture differences well between samples. Newer models might read more deeply than did mine. The first test that I ran was to test a piece of 1/2 inch thick drywall, then move the flat of my hand up to it, until I saw a difference. By itself, the drywall reads at roughly 5-6%, my hand by itself reads off the top of the scale. When my hand approaches to within roughly 1/2inch, the meter sees a difference, jumping up by about 3-4%. It could also recognize the presence of my hand on the other side of a 3/4 inch thick telephone book. Of course, this is a poor test for what you are doing. Suppose that moisture collects on the inside of a vapor barrier inside the wall, separated by over an inch from the interior wall surface? Were this to happen, the air space between the two surfaces will be maintained at a high humidity. In turn, this will significantly raise the moisture content of the interior wall surface. I next did a test where I showed that drywall faced with a somewhat moister environment on one side would then easily register several percent high in moisture content. This last test convinces me that you can indeed check for elevated moisture content of a wall cavity using a non-invasive and inexpensive moisture meter.
How do I replace an old Roomba's battery? I've got an old iRobot Roomba "3100 Pro Elite" whose battery has died. A new Roomba is EUR 300 and upward, so I would prefer to revive the one I have. It's difficult (impossible?) to find replacement batteries in Austria (Europe), and they are so expensive that I haven't yet convinced myself the cost is worth it. But it would be nice to revive the Roomba as it is in decent working condition, mechanically, except for the cheap rubber treads that I have glued back on. Do you have suggestions for where to get a replacement battery for this specific Roomba? Would it make sense to try this DIY approach, considering I've never tried soldering on batteries? I'd hate to have this thing explode in my living room. Where would I get batteries from? The page's discussion thread refers to a U.S. website.
How do I replace an old Roomba's battery? I would try getting a crow bar or 2x4 under the slab and seeing if you could lift it up enough to get some gravel underneath it to level it off. Although this could be difficult if the ground around the slab is soft. Step 4: Check concrete pad on which condenser rests to make sure it's level. Set carpenters' level front to back and side to side on top of unit. If pad has settled, lift pad with pry bar or piece of 2-by-4, then force gravel or rocks under concrete to level it. http://home.howstuffworks.com/how-to-maintain-an-air-conditioner2.htm
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? I had a concrete wall painted with white water-dispersion paint. Every here and there the old paint was chipped and dark gray bare concrete could be seen. I got a can of white water-dispersion paint and coloured it into light-green tone. The instructions on the paint say "prime the surface, then apply two layers of paint". That's what I did exactly. The wall looks great now except that the dark gray concrete can be seen through the paint layer (yes, not only the surface is not flat, but also dark gray concrete can be identified through two layers of paint) - looks like the paint doesn't block light that much. The parts of the wall where the old paint wasn't chipped look just great. How should I have prepared the wall so that those dark gray regions of concrete were not visible through new paint?
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? You might be able to use "Mudjacking", although this would require hiring a professional. Mudjacking is the process of pumping a water, dirt and cement mixture under a concrete slab in order to lift it. This mixture is called slurry. The exact ingredients vary from company to company, and from job to job. Mudjacking can be the solution to many homeowners’ concrete problems, including foundation settling, crumbling curbs and repairing falling sidewalks. It may also be called concrete leveling, pressure grouting or slabjacking. http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-mudjacking.htm
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? I would not bother to pay someone to do this. If the tilt is small, why bother anyway? I would do this the simple way. Pick a spot where you can insert a large crowbar/prybar underneath the edge of the slab, where you will wish to raise it. You may need to dig out a small amount of dirt there to get a firm grip. In front of that spot, place a piece of wood to use as a point of leverage. It will also prevent the bar from sinking into the ground when you lift. The slab plus the air conditioning unit will be moderately heavy, so expect to need a long prybar to lift it. A friend may be of help here to help you to lift, as well as place a few well placed stones to support the slab after you have raised it to level. One problem is the slab may crack if it is left without adequate support. To prevent this from happening, after you raise the slab to level, inject some expanding foam insulation into the void under your slab. This foam will expand to fill in that void, providing support for the slab. While you might think that simple foam would be unable to provide much support, remember that it dries to a stiff, hard consistency, and the load per square inch from that slab will not be massive.
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? My first recommendation would be to contact the maker of iRobot and see what they can do for you, I know that in the US we can get batteries from them easily. Now, if you wanted to go the route of building your own battery as it noted in the link you posted, it isn't "that" complicated. You can get yourself some much better detailed instructions on how to build the battery pack using instructions for "Radio Controlled Car Battery Pack" creation as they us the same Sub-C cells for the battery packs.
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? More coats of primer might have done the trick. Paints have different levels of coverage/opacity. If you wanted to even out the texture, that is harder; maybe some sort of skim coat over the entire wall, to unify it? Or pre-paint/joint compound/etc. over just the areas that were chipped. I don't know whether you can add additional layers over your existing paint; the can may give more info about overcoats.
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? Is the unit on legs? If so, the legs might be adjustable. One bit of caution, some units are actually supposed to be tilted slightly (<1 inch). This is to enable water and snow to drain out the side, versus pooling in the bottom. Unless your unit is really messed up, you should be able to shim under it.
How do I prepare concrete walls before applying water-dispersion paint? Ebay - that's where I got my replacement. It's NOT an iRobot manufactured battery pack (nor does it claim to be), but it works fine. I think it came from someone in Hong Kong, and the shipping wasn't bad at all - I don't know how shipping in your area would be. I looked at opening the pack up and replacing the cells, but I couldn't figure out how to get the thing open without damaging it.
How do I install a sink in a room that doesn't have a drain vent? I want to install a sink in my attached garage where there is no existing plumbing. I will be running new water supply and drain pipes to mains behind a nearby wall. I'm concerned I will need a drain vent to avoid a slow or gurgling drain. What is a good design to avoid plumbing problems once installed?
How do I install a sink in a room that doesn't have a drain vent? Yours is a not uncommon problem, so a solution does exist. For example, how might one vent a sink in an island in the center of a kitchen? I looked online, and it seems there are two common solutions. You can use what is called a vacuum breaker, which lets air into the line to prevent slow/gurgly drain problems without allowing sewer gases into the area. The second option is an island loop vent. Both are described clearly in this link: http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Plumbing/Kitchen-Plumbing/how-to-plumb-an-island-sink
How do I install a sink in a room that doesn't have a drain vent? There is a vent that can be mounted to a pipe going about half way up a wall. In my basement, I have one on the backside of a wall (on an unfinished side). It has a check valve to prevent smells from the sewer pipes from getting into the room. You could put it in a box on the wall of your garage and cover it if desired with something that looks like a cabinet.
How do I install a sink in a room that doesn't have a drain vent? Mike B.'s answer is correct. But also, you might not need to replace it. After watching the first video in Mike B's answer, I took mine apart. The video showed a spiral spring. My spring was actually a bent piece of sheet metal (kind of like a U with a dimple in one side). It had simply become loose and needed to be put back in place.
What size dowels to use for joints? I'm comfortable with the process of creating and joining wood with dowels, but I'm not sure what size dowels to use in which cases? Specifically, I'm working with 1" thick stock (3/4" actual), what size should I use? What are the other sizes and lengths of dowels used for? Are there any recommended grouping or spacing for wood dowels?
What is the proper way to patch acoustic ceiling after collecting possible asbestos sample? I want to collect additional samples of an acoustic ceiling for the purpose of having it checked for asbestos. The previous test came back negative but I'm paranoid =) The procedure as per instructions on my prior collection kit was: Spray water (light soap/water mix) while collecting sample. Double bag the sample. What I'm confused on is: What are the best areas in the ceiling to take a sample? How large of a sample could I be collecting? The test is supposed to be able to detect 1% asbestos by volume. How do I patch/seal the area where I took the sample? Any thoughts? The ceiling is in great condition so far with no cracks or significant abrasions so I want to keep it that way (especially if there is asbestos). -M
What is the proper way to patch acoustic ceiling after collecting possible asbestos sample? The best work I know of on the topic was written by Tage Frid (see http://amazon.com). The approximate rule-of-thumb, iirc, is to use a dowel no more than 3/8 the thickness of the wood to be joined (and not less than 1/4 the thickness). Expansion For example, if you are joining 5/4 boards (finished thickness 1"), the dowels should be between 1/4" and 3/8" in diameter. Likewise, if joining finished thickness 3/4" boards, use between 3/16" and 9/32" diameter dowels. This presumes, of course, you're joining the boards on the narrow dimension (e.g. making a door frame).
What is the proper way to patch acoustic ceiling after collecting possible asbestos sample? My thoughts on your first question would be to take a sample from a few different rooms, if you can see any differences between color/texture on the ceilings. From asbestos.com: If the material looks different (especially in color or texture) in different parts of the room, plan to sample each of those areas. For a ceiling surface in a large room, two samples may be needed to determine your asbestos situation. Try to balance the need to protect your family from exposure after you sample (to sample in an inconspicuous area) with the need to get a representative sample of the material (to sample in the center of the room). I'm not sure about the size of sample required, but I don't think you'd need more than a few square inches. As for patching the ceiling, you should prime the sample spot before painting. After that, you can mix some standard ceiling paint with a texture additive to match the consistency of your original ceiling. Since it's a small area, you can probably get away with using a brush, or possibly a small roller. Or, instead of bothering with texture matching, you could go the easy route and use spray-on popcorn ceiling texture after priming (beware the horrible product reviews though - it might be easier to use a pre-mixed product).
How do I join 2x4s without mitering? I asked this question on the Bicycles site: DIY wooden bike rack — looking for plans I'm planning to build this rack out of 2x4 pieces of wood. It'll live in my garage. I'm looking to make a rack similar to one of these, but simpler and, obviously, not made of metal: (photo credit) My question is, how can I join 2x4s so they'll be strong, particularly the ones that are horizontal? The stand won't support the weight of the bikes, but it will keep them upright. (Several of my bikes don't have kickstands.) I'd like to avoid mitering the joins, to make construction simpler, since I don't have a miter box. (We have a circ saw and a regular wood saw.)
How do I join 2x4s without mitering? Go to your local big box store (Home Depot / Lowes / etc) and look into joist hanging / decking hardware, such as these.
How should I paint pine furniture? I built a bed for my son out of Pine (from plans on the internet.) I am going to paint it white. What kinds of preparation do I need to do to the wood, especially considering the 4 posts are from pressure-treated pine -- the kind of wood you use on a deck that you buy from Home Depot that probably is treated to keep away insects and repel moisture. Sanding - how fine? 220 grit? Anything after sanding like a sealant?
How should I paint pine furniture? I would not ever use pressure-treated wood for any internal application - framing or furniture. Go buy non-pressure treated 4x4s, or sister together two 2x4s to build 4x4s. Otherwise, I sand pine down to 180 grit, prime, and paint.
How should I paint pine furniture? For outdoor use, I've always heard that you have to let treated wood dry for a year before painting, but the exact time may vary based on how dry the local climate is. But Adam Musch is right -- pressure treated is treated with poison -- arsenic, copper, cyanide (until about 2003, when most companies started using less poisonous chemicals). You don't want to be using it inside, and sanding's a bad idea unless you're vaccuuming up the dust and wearing as mask.
How do I clean vinyl siding without a pressure washer? My vinyl siding is turning green from mildew and I have to clean it up this weekend. I let a friend borrow my pressure washer at the beginning of the summer, and he's out of the country for awhile. I'm working that angle to try and get it back. I called for a rental and found that it's pretty expensive to rent one, even for a few hours. Are there any products out there that can you can spray on and rinse with a hose? These stains are 20+ feet up, so I'll bite the bullet on the tool rental before I get up there to scrub. My dad recommended giving Jomax a try. Any experience with this?
How do I clean vinyl siding without a pressure washer? I would never use the old CCA treated wood in an exposed indoor area, especially for a toddler bed. However, contrary to what others have said, the new ACQ treated wood should be perfectly safe. It does not contain aresenic or cyanide. Also, ACQ wood has a much higher copper content than the old CCA wood did (to make up for not having the arsenic). Because of this, it is much more corrosive to fasteners. Make sure you use either hot-dipped galvanized or stainless steel fasteners to ensure that they don't corrode and fail on you.
What are the pros and cons of a cultured marble tub? I'm in the middle of a bathroom remodel (tear-out done), and the next step is to choose a tub. From a materials perspective, what are the pros and cons of using a cultured marble tub? For instance, resistance to scratching and chipping, noise, color-fastness over time, etc.
What are the pros and cons of a cultured marble tub? I wouldn't use miter joints for a project like this anyway -- they're mainly for appearance, not strength. Unless you want it to look pretty I'd stick with lap-type joints, where the pieces overlap each other. Then you can just screw them together with deck screws, or for even more strength you can glue them too. If you want to enhance the appearance you can create an official lap joint like this: The advantage being that your boards end up in the same plane and look a bit less klugey. You could make these either with your hand saw (tedious), or by making several half-depth cuts with your circular saw and removing the remaining material with a chisel. Where you need to butt a 2x4 up against the flat of another, this won't work. The best joint to use in this case would be a dado: You can make these with your circular saw and chisel too. With some glue and a couple of screws through the long piece into the end of the butted piece, this makes for a very strong, nice-looking joint.
Pros and Cons of floated flooring We just bought a new house which needs extensive remodeling. Our contractor, after ripping out the existing old carpet and damaged subfloor/padding, discovered that the floor was quite uneven, so we had an idea to install floated flooring for the hardwood (strand bamboo) that we were planning to replace the carpet with. Can anyone suggest the pros and cons of the floated flooring approach?
Pros and Cons of floated flooring My thoughts? EEK! I think this is a recipe for trouble. I hope this was not suggested by the contractor? These floors need smooth surfaces underneath, with underlayment that will support the flooring. If there will be serious problems like that, they need to be fixed before you put down flooring. Otherwise, you will have flooring that flexes every time you walk over a spot. You will have loud squeeks. The joints between the pieces will open up and close, allowing dirt to lodge in there, unsightly lines will appear in the flooring. With enough flexing, the hard surface coating on that flooring will start to crack. While padding is used underneath these floating floors, the flooring is simply not stiff and strong enough to resist the flexing I am talking about. Do the job right the first time. You don't want to tear it out and redo it later. If the cost of repairing the subfloor is too much, just replace the carpet.
Pros and Cons of floated flooring Miter joints are simply not strong enough here to support the loads they will see. And glue won't be strong enough either to keep the miters together. End-grain to end-grain does not make for a strong glue joint. I've used hand cut mortice and tenon joinery on 2x4 construction before. Yes, it was overkill, but it was fun to do. :) It does yield a strong joint, one that you will trust. It is not even that difficult to do, since the 2x4s are soft wood to cut even with a handsaw and chisel. For even more assurance, after the joints are assembled, drill a hole through the joint, and insert a dowel through it to prevent the tenon from pulling out.
Pros and Cons of floated flooring I know you mentioned that you want to build the bike rack out of wood (and 2x4s) but... You could probably build nearly that exact bike rack out of PVC pipe or even a slightly simpler design: http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/goodies/TruckbedBikeRack.htm
Pros and Cons of floated flooring Our house is on a slab foundation, and has floated flooring in a large part of the house.. The previous owners had the foundation repaired at some point, and while it may be better than it was before the repair, there are still places with noticeable flex in the flooring. Do not simply install a floating floor material over a non-flat surface.
How do I improve hot water pressure from a gas combination boiler? I have a gas combination boiler (no hot water tank). The hot water pressure isn't very good though - the showers and hot taps come out with maybe half the pressure when compared to the cold straight from the mains. Given that the mains pressure is good what is the best way to get more of that pressure through to the hot water? My boiler is a 6 year old Ferroli F24 - would a new boiler make a significant improvement? Given the expense I'd rather only do that if it both the only way and guaranteed to make an improvement.
How do I improve hot water pressure from a gas combination boiler? How updated is your wiring? In an old house, it might still have knob and tube wiring. If this is the case then I wouldn't want to mess with wiring up a disposal. However, if the wiring has been redone with modern stuff, then its pretty easy. I put one in my 1920s house (with updated wiring) earlier this year. The main problem I had is that every spot on my breaker box was already full. (See question I asked about this here.) Code does in fact require the disposal to have its own circuit, but for me this was difficult option. Instead I just spliced into the existing kitchen circuit. By my calculations, a 1/4 HP disposal (which is really all you need) will draw about 1.5 Amps of current. .25 HP = 186 Watts 186 Watts / 120 V = 1.5 Amps I calculated the max power draw of all the kitchen appliances plus the new disposal, and it was well under the 20 Amp max of the circuit. It seems silly to dedicate a whole circuit to an appliance that shouldn't draw over 2 Amps. A double check of the specs on my 1/4 HP disposal indicates it pulls up to 9 Amps! Don't do what I did. Put the disposal on its own circuit. $650-$750 is a lot to pay. If you're home's wiring can handle it, it's something you can do yourself for about $150 in materials and a few hours of work.
How full can my sump pit get before I should worry? After dealing with this issue by adding a circuit dedicated to the sump pump, it has been very dry in my area. The sump pump hasn't kicked on in the month or so since the circuit was added. I wasn't worried... However, the last week has been a wet one. Today, especially, has been near flood conditions to the point that they are closing many local schools. I still have not seen or heard the pump come on. The sump pump power runs into the power cord from a switch, which then plugs directly into the dedicated circuit. The switch cord connects to a float set up in the sump pit, along with the pump itself. The sump pit is a 25+ gallon pit with several drainage lines feeding into it at various levels. It has standing water in the pit, which I, as I understand things, does not necessarily indicate a problem. However, the water has risen above the highest drainage pipe, to within six inches of the lip. Still, the pump has not switched on. I tried manually running the pump, and it operates fine, draining fairly quickly - half an inch or so in under 60s even during a moderate amount of rainfall. So my concern isn't that there are problems with the pump. Rather, I am concerned about the switch. I do not see the float anywhere in the water. How high can the water get before it is certain that there is a problem? Note that my fiancee and I are leaving town on Saturday to get married. We will be gone for two weeks. More rain is anticipated, so if I need to replace the switch, it must be tonight or tomorrow. Edit to include pics: This is what the pit looks like currently: This is the water-level of the pit. The brown line on the stick marks the water-line. The paint-can is a full-size paint can, used to show scale:
How full can my sump pit get before I should worry? I'm sorry, but you say that it drains out only 1/2 an inch from the crock in 60 seconds time when it does run? If so, then you either have a clog in the outflow line, or the pump is bad. Our pump will drain the entire crock in a matter of seconds. If the pump is not turning on with the float totally submerged, then the switch may be a problem too.
How full can my sump pit get before I should worry? It should definately come on before the water gets to that level. Is the float the kind that has its cord clamped to a pipe and it swings up and down? If its that kind, make sure that its not hung up on anything. You may need to manually run the pump to empty the water and troubleshoot the float. Lift it and see if the pump comes on. Does the float have a separate cord that plugs into the outlet and then the pump plugs into the back of the floats plug? I agree that it should pump more than a half inch per minute. I would think it would be normal to empty the tank in around 20-30 seconds.
Is there a way to convert my regular toilet seat to one that's like a Toto...so the seat won't slam shut? Are there hinges out there that I can use to convert my toilet seat so that it won't slam shut? Other methods?
Is there a way to convert my regular toilet seat to one that's like a Toto...so the seat won't slam shut? You CAN buy (on the order of 10 dollars) a test kit from your local home center. These are usually a package of strips that you dip in the water. These strips contain reactants that change color to indicate various contaminants in your water. Having said that, those kits are not terribly accurate, but they will be reasonable. If you have a lot of something in your water, the kit will flag a problem. Just don't expect high accuracy. Of course, you can always call in the water people - those who will try to sell you a complete water treatment system, at a cost of many thousands of dollars. They have a vested interest in selling you something. They can test your water too, though not as accurately as an independent lab would do. A reputable, independent lab will be far more accurate, and has no vested interest in a sale. But expect to pay a reasonable fee for that service. So to answer whether there is a "good" way to test water quality, we would need to understand how much accuracy you want to see, and how much money you would be willing to spend.
What should I look for in a Whole House Fan I see a lot of variance in the prices of whole house fans in the market, and not a lot of clarity or comparison between vendors and models. We're looking to buy some to install in our newly purchased duplex. What are some things to look for and common issues or concerns with the installation and operation of these devices?
Can I use a 1 1/2 vent for a toilet (3" drain) in CA (not a went vent, no other fixtures on it)? Most of the info I have on code implies this would be OK, but one item I have says that a 1 1/2 vent can only serve 8 "non-WC" fixture units.
Can I use a 1 1/2 vent for a toilet (3" drain) in CA (not a went vent, no other fixtures on it)? I have one in my house, never really had a problem with it. They are a bit loud though, so put it someplace out of the way - putting it in the kitchen or living room or anyplace people like to congregate and talk would not be a good idea. The only other thing to look out for is what happens in the winter. The big problem with ours is that while the louvers close automatically when it isn't in use, in the winter heat has no problem escaping through those louvers into the attic. It might seem like a minor thing, but it's easily noticeable - in the winter my whole roof is covered with snow except for a bare rectangle directly above the fan. They make styrofoam covers that you can place over the attic fan, but that requires you to get up in the attic every winter and put it on, then take it off every spring, which can be pain if you don't have easy attic access. Another solution (the one we use) is to use one of those window insulating kits (with the tape and plastic, where you heat it with a hair dryer) and put that over the louvers. It works reasonably well, but not ideal. If you could get an attic fan that had some kind of real solution for this built in - say an automatically retractable cover, or one with a pull chain, that would be ideal. Not sure if they even make such a thing, but it's something to look for. ETA: Another thing to watch out for - make sure your attic has plenty of ventilation. Those fans move a lot of air, and you'll need plenty of ventilation in the attic to make sure all that air can get out.
How do I repair terrazzo floors? I just bought an older house and it has terrazzo floors the whole way through. The previous owner installed carpet using tack strips that were nailed to the floor, instead of using contact cement, so when the carpet and the tack strips were removed it left divots in the floor along the baseboards of every room. Is there any way to repair this?
How do I repair terrazzo floors? It's possible, but probably something that you would call in a professional for. Even assuming that you had epoxy resin based floors, you'd still have to match the existing colors and sizes of the terrazzo pieces, clean out the nail holes, refill them, and grind and polish so they're level with the rest of the floor. EDIT: Found this article that suggests that repairing an epoxy based floor might be easier than I thought. I'd still get some professional advice first though.
How do I repair terrazzo floors? DEFINITELY get professional advice here. If there are many floors of this type in your area, there will also be someone who specializes in repairing them. Start asking around. Call a few people who can create this type of floor. Somebody will know who does repair work on them. If you do find someone who claims to be able to repair them, get references and talk to the references. An alternative to a repair might be to consider some sort of baseboard molding around the perimeter of your floors, to hide the divots. Of course, there may be spots in doorways where that is more difficult to do.
How do I repair terrazzo floors? Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. I wish I took before/after pics. Bought: Jomax Clorox Outdoor Put in a garden sprayer designed for bleach according to instructions on Jomax: 3/4 cups Jomax 2 1/4 cups bleach 13 cups water For 75% of the siding, I applied the mixture, then rinsed after 5 minutes. A number of sections needed a second application, and the worst section took three. I rinsed using one of the "fireman" nozzles on my hose, just so I could get it up to the eaves: I did try just spraying the mildew with the nozzle...worthless. "Firemen" should sue for defamation. Anyway, I'm thrilled. Probably took 25% longer than last year, but I wasn't dripping wet either :) I'll get a power sprayer for next year, but I'll definitely stick with this; it looks much better than what I get from pressure washing alone.
Is cleaning the tub with bleach bad for the plumbing? My wife had a brainstorm and we tried cleaning the tub with a dilute bleach solution, letting it soak overnight, and it worked very well. The tub still needs a cleaning, but the bleach loosened the worst of the dirt. I'm viewing this is a pre-step to a proper scrubbing, but one that will make the actual cleaning easier. If we were to do this regularly, say every few weeks, could this be bad for the pipes?
Is cleaning the tub with bleach bad for the plumbing? Buy a new toilet seat. The big box stores sell several that are billed as "Whisper Close" "SlowClose", etc. We're talking $30-40 here (as opposed to $10-20 for a low-end toilet seat) so it's not like I'd be concerned with preserving the existing seat.
How do I replace mortise locks with bored cylindrical locks? I purchased an older home that has mortise locks in all of the doors. They're all very difficult to use and some of them don't work at all, making the doors difficult to impossible to close. Since I'm going to have to do some work on the doors anyway, I would like to convert the doors to use cylindrical locks, instead. Is there one standard way to go about doing this? I would guess I'd have to fill the mortise pocket in the door with plywood and then use a template to bore the holes into the door. I'm a little less clear about what would have to be done with the door jamb. I've never done anything like this, and I want to make sure there isn't anything that I'm missing before attempting to do this.
How do I replace mortise locks with bored cylindrical locks? You say you'll be removing the old lock, so why not replace the mortise locks and if you buy 5 or 7 lever ones they'll be more secure than the bored cylindrical lock. Make sure you buy one with the handle spindle in the same position as the old lock. When it comes to the door jamb, a lot of mortise locks have a "box keep" rather than just a plate defining the holes for the latch and the lock. See the photo on the Mortise Lock Wikipedia page for an example. This makes them more secure and you don't have to find an exact replacement as you'll be chiselling out a bit more of the jamb anyway. The problem with replacing the mortise with a bored cylindrical lock is that the new lock is smaller than the old and really has to be in the same location on the door as it's the strongest part of the door. You'd have to fill the mortise hole with a solid block of wood which might well entail digging out more of the door to get a good fit. This would weaken the door. The same applies to the door jamb.
How do I care for the land area directly above a septic tank? Any suggestions for how to care for the land area directly above a septic tank? I'm a first-time home buyer with a septic tank in my front yard. I'd like it to be aesthetically pleasing and consistent with the rest of the yard but didn't know if there was any special considerations to be aware of (e.g. don't water, mow, seed, etc). -M
Are air purifiers and ionizers effective? Are air ionizers and other air purifiers effective at cleaning the air? Is there any evidence that such machines lead to improved health or wellbeing?
What kind of paint should be used to protect gas meter? During our home inspection, the inspector mentioned that the gas meter wasn't painted and could be subject to rusting later but he didn't elaborate on what paint to use. Anyone have suggestions here? Are there paint types specifically made for this? -M
What kind of paint should be used to protect gas meter? You can pretty much do anything above a septic tank, as long as you aren't going to be doing major landscaping that requires tractors, heavy equipment, etc.. The one thing you do want to be aware of is the location of any inspection pipes, or manholes that might have a negative effect on mower blades. Trying to mow around these nice yard "features" can be quite frustrating. For our old system, we mulched around the area containing the manholes and inspection pipes (~ 4" white pvc pipe with a cap), and planted a nice flower garden around it. We had our 3-year pumpings scheduled in the early spring before we plant, and if we needed work done on the system, flowers are easy enough to re-plant. There are also some realistic looking fake hollow rocks you can buy- we'll probably do this at our new place, as the covers are in an area not well suited to a flower garden.
What kind of paint should be used to protect gas meter? I wouldn't water the septic drain field. I would leave it dry so it can absorb as much water from the septic as possible.
What kind of paint should be used to protect gas meter? If you use oxygen bleach, its safe for the septic. I like a product called Stain Solver (stainsolver.com). In fact, they recommend putting some in periodically to clean the septic tank.
Questions concerning dual flush converters I'm considering purchasing dual-flush converters for our toilets and was curious if anyone had thoughts on them. Specifically, I'd like to know: Are there any major disadvantages to using them? How difficult are they to install? Are there any specific considerations to keep in mind for houses using septic systems? -M
Questions concerning dual flush converters Bleach is really tough on surfaces and over time may damage the tub. If its diluted, I don't think that it will affect pipes, but then again, just about anything is bad for 100 year old iron pipe. After you get the tub clean enough, I'd recommend using one of those daily spray tub/shower cleaners or a steam cleaner like a Haan. The bad thing is that you need to use these products more often, but the good thing is that it takes minutes and little work vs. scrubbing and burning your lungs.
Questions concerning dual flush converters If you're in the US, talk to your local county extension office. If they don't do water testing, they'll know who to talk to. If you're in a rural area, be sure to test in the spring after the local farmers have applied fertilizers.
Is this electrical junction up to code? I was up in my attic a few days ago, and I noticed a pretty ugly electrical junction that wasn't in a junction box. Here's the pic: Is this up to code? FWIW I live in north Alabama, outside city limits. However I'm assuming there are general building codes that would govern this sort of thing nationwide. At first I was horrified when I saw this, but then I remembered the home inspector had to have passed this several times when he was going over the house prior to our purchase. In fact, I SAW him walk right past where it was - I just stuck my head up in the attic while he went tromping around across the trusses. Am I just super OCD and this is a perfectly fine junction, or was it a major oversight on the inspector's part? Unless someone tells me otherwise, I'm planning on installing a junction box tomorrow, but I'd rather not waste my money/time if it's fine how it is.
Is this electrical junction up to code? Up/downs that I'm aware of: Aluminum is more corrosion resistant. Steel is more fire resistant without underlayment. Aluminum is (at least a few years ago) more expensive. There are a couple of different galvanizing techniques used with steel. Understand the differences that apply to your weather conditions. Both roof types will likely outlive you. Both roof types can display cosmetic damage from heavy hail, but offer a higher level of protection for the life of the roof. Asphalt will lose its protective ability over time. You can offset the cosmetic issues by choosing roof patterns that will camouflage. Noise from rain/snow/etc isn't an issue unless your installer is clueless. I just did a roof, and couldn't afford metal. If I could, I'd choose based on the cost, local code and competence of the contractors offering the roof. Roofing is an area where you need to be careful with low bidders. Make sure the roofer is certified by the roof manufacturer and is following manufacturer installation guidelines.
Is this electrical junction up to code? At first glance, I see several problems: The junction should be in a junction box. Is there even an electrical nut on the live wires? Hard to tell under all that electrical tape, but it doesn't look as if there's room for one. Is the neutral from the red wire at top going into that tangle of lives? If it's carrying live, it should be tagged to indicate that. The red wire to the right shouldn't be running along the top of the ceiling joist. If you can, run it along the middle of one of the sides. Ideally, the yellow wire at bottom would pass through a hole drilled through the joist. Failing that, there should be furring strips either side to prevent you from stepping on it. The electrical tape on the neutral and ground wires isn't strictly necessary for code, but if it's there, it's customary to have it go around the nut to help hold it in place. Thanks to @tester101: different sheath colors indicates different gauge wires. Check that your circuit breaker has the appropriate amperage rating. Staples: if you run wires across the joists, they should be stapled to keep them in place between the furring strips (that you also need; see #5). You'll also need them along the length of the wires that run along the joists, and it might be a good idea to have one near where the wire drops down through the 2x4 header (given the quality of the rest of the job, whoever did this may not have used staples when running the wire through the wall cavity). It looks as if you might have a lot of slack in those wires. Wiring shouldn't be piano-wire taut, but you don't want enough slack that you can trip over it. Just because the inspector didn't mention it, doesn't mean it's OK. They're human, so they can miss things, especially in an attic where the lighting isn't good.
Is this electrical junction up to code? My ionizer probably did clean the air -- the walls near it were starting to turn gray with all the fine dust particles settling down. However, I didn't notice any change in my wellbeing. I heard somewhere that someone even sued one of the companies that sell these ionizers for false claims that use of ionizers improves health.
Is this electrical junction up to code? Before I bought an air purifier a few years back, I found a Consumer Reports test of such machines, including several filter-based models and at least one ionizer. The ionizer received a failing grade. According to Wikipedia, the manufacturer subsequently sued Consumer Reports for product defamation and lost. I don't have the Consumer Reports article anymore, but if I remember correctly, the only effective air purifiers were filter-based. Only a few models had much effect, and only when the fan was run at the highest (and loudest) speed. We have had a filter-based air purifier (made by Sears) for about three years. It cost about $300, and the annual filter cost is about $150. It is effective in the sense that the filter does get dirty, but my (subjective) impression is that its cleaning effect is small compared to regular vacuum cleaning and dusting. We haven't noticed any health improvements—but we didn't have dust allergies or other dust-related health problems either. Apparently there have been studies into high levels of negative ions as a treatment for seasonal-affective disorder. I have not read the papers or otherwise evaluated the research, and I don't know if commercially available air purifiers produce anions at the levels that are claimed to be clinically relevant.
Is this electrical junction up to code? I'm amazed that your inspector didn't call this out. I suppose it could be just a random fluke that it was missed, but this is something that even the greenest inspector should have easily seen and noted. I agree with all of Niall C.'s points, but would add that this looks like nothing a professional electrician would put together (and would certainly not have passed the electrical building inspection), and so is probably something added by a previous owner. If I were you I'd find out where these wires go and check out whatever's at the other ends. You may find a mess there too that needs to be fixed.
How do I fill a hole under a sidewalk? The sidewalk leading up to my front door developed what looked like a sink hole under it about a year ago. Since then, an animal of some kind has made the hole even bigger and it now runs as a tunnel under my pathway. QUESTION: How to I fill this hole most effectively? Obviously it would be great if I could do it cheaply and without busting up the sidewalk. CONCERNS: I like in Omaha, NE. We have extreme winters and summers. I thought about pouring concrete into the hole, but I'm concerned that it would expand under the sidewalk and cause buckling and cracking. I also thought about filling it with just dirt and sand, but I'm concerned that I won't be able to get the hole filled directly under the middle of the sidewalk, thus not supporting the weight load put in the walkway.
Can I lay down plywood in my attic to create a storage space? I've got an older house, built in 1919 (stacked stone foundation, brick, lots of heavy lumber) and I got this crazy idea I could build out the 3rd floor into a FAR more useful space than it is now. I'm not sure why some other owner didn't think/attempt this so may there is something I am missing -- someone DID put a HUGE antenna in there but beyond that, a single light socket and all the loose insulation, its untouched. The cross beams in the attic are 10x2 and stupid strong (busts nails, no really) being about 13" apart. The roof is shaped in a steep V and high enough I can stand up easily (I'm 6'8) and it's all completely open -- 16' wide by ... probably 50' deep - all of which is utterly wasted. I'm thinking I could feed some plywood up there to create a floor and start building it out into more useable, maybe even living space. The biggest catch as of right now is the opening -- it's <2' by 3'. Barely big enough to me to sneak my way in there and MAYBE bend some 8'x2' sheets up there (rip an 8x4). Really what I need it for today is simply storage. Long term, we'd like to build a walk-out 3rd floor but since in ~100 years no one else has bothered...it makes me think "why didn't someone?". Any ideas/thoughts on this?
Can I lay down plywood in my attic to create a storage space? A concrete leveling company could do the job. I hired a company to raise my driveway back to level. They drilled a small hole in the cement pad and pumped in hydraulic cement. It leveled out the pad and they assured me that it won't be bothered by frost heave. The leveling service might be your best option to ensure that the hole is filled. If that hole collapses it would put stress on the middle of the sidewalk (if the hole is large enough), causing it to split. This is pretty much what happened to my driveway, the ground sank only in one section and the strain on the corner of the concrete was too great and it split where the ground dropped.
Can I lay down plywood in my attic to create a storage space? As far as the opening goes, you can put in a collapsing ladder, such as this one. I've installed one before and they're not too bad, just a little framing work and some large nails (I used 16p nails and you'll need a friend or two to help, the ladder and frame is somewhat weighty). This gives you a ladder and an easy way to get up to the attic and it collapses down to just a panel which can be painted and framed to make it look nice against the ceiling. The attic in my house just has some plywood on the truss floor which serves as a great storage floor. Just have to be sure not to block the air flow in the attic and realize that it may get very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. I made the mistake of storing some candles in boxes one summer ..... wound up with candle blobs when I discovered them again.
Can I lay down plywood in my attic to create a storage space? Fill the hole with concrete. Concrete doesn't expand in the cold -- you're probably thinking of frost heave, which is where moisture in the soil freezes and expands, disturbing whatever's above it. If your sidewalk hasn't heaved by now, then the addition of new concrete below it isn't going to change anything. Filling the hole with dirt or sand may in fact cause the heaving you're concerned about though -- I can imagine a situation where you're unable to properly compact the dirt underneath the sidewalk, creating a nice loosely-filled pocket for water to sit in and freeze.
Can I lay down plywood in my attic to create a storage space? When it comes to make the hatch invisible, I personally use a large flowers vase. Previously I had a human statue (of manageable weight). It adds a nice touch of classic to the garden, and it can be removed easily from the hatch when you require emptying. Unfortunately it is prone to falling when you have a dog or small children. The vase is a much safer solution.
Can I lay down plywood in my attic to create a storage space? As you said you had loose insulation, I don't know if it's at the floor joist level, and so you can just sheet directly over the joists, or if it's above the joists, in which case you need to get creative. First, there are some companies that make these sort of plastic grid pieces that screw into the joists so you can make a walkway and still let the insulation breathe ... but they're specific sizes, so if your rafters aren't the standard 16" or 24", you're out of luck. And they're rather expensive when you start dealing with them for both the walkway, and the storage. The alternative is to only lay the walkway, down, not where you're going to be storing stuff. If you need extra depth for insulation, make a "ladder" out of dimensional lumber (2x4, 2x6, etc) to get up to the height of your insulation, nestle that into the insulation, secure it in place, then sweep out any extra insulation (so you're not packing it down), then sheet over top of the ladder. For storage, if you're mostly storing lightweight stuff up there (and let's face it ... if you're bringing it up and down a ladder, you're not using this to store heavy items), you can work from the roof down -- get some pieces of chain, a few screw hooks, and something as shelves (even a cheap set of wire shelves from target/walmart/etc), and you have storage without crushing down the insulation. ... One of these years, I'll get a contractor to come in, jack up the roof another four feet, add a knee-wall, and I can get a whole second floor (well, storage under the eaves), but that's a long-term project, as I'm going to have to get new siding at the same time, unless someone can match 80 year old wood siding. And I'm going to have to lose a bedroom to turn into a stairwell. When that point comes, I'll probably get the sprayed-on insulation, as I'll have to insulate the roof, and I'm not looking forward to having to deal with batts of insulation over my head. (although, they do have ones made from recycled bluejeans now, so maybe it won't be as itchy) I also assume I'm going to have to get permits and make sure the joists would be rated to support the necessary live load; mine are 24"OC 2x6, so I might need reinforcing. (although, they're old school, 1.75"x5.75", not today's 1.5"x5.5", and they're mostly petrified at this point)
How do I install a receptacle box in lath/plaster wall? I have a room with ungrounded electrical receptacles and I need to install a grounded outlet. The walls are lath and plaster. What I want to do is install a new receptacle box for the outlet. Is there a way to do this without having a big hole to repair? Basically I'd just like to cut a hole just big enough for the receptacle box, but not sure if it's possible. I can easily get a wire to the desired location. I'm just not sure of how to get a receptacle box into the wall. There is a stud at the spot for an attachment point. Any links to a site with pictures or diagrams would be a real plus.
How do I install a receptacle box in lath/plaster wall? I did something similar, and my wall is lathe-and-plaster, but covered with drywall. I started by drilling a hole with a hole saw, then extended the hole to the size of a receptacle box using an electric jigsaw. A bit of dust, but it worked wonderfully; it was not hard to make the hole the right size and shape. I don't know if it would be different if there were no drywall. Perhaps I would have to worry about the plaster chipping around the edges? I also discovered that I needed to use a shallow receptacle box, for there was not enough space inside the wall for a regular one.
How do I install a receptacle box in lath/plaster wall? I think you would be better off using a remodeling box (with the flanges that rotate out to grip the wall) and ignore the stud altogether. With a remodeling box, you just have to cut a hole big enough for the box, whereas if you use a regular box, you have to cut away more so you have room to nail it into the stud. The main difficulties you'll face are that you don't know exactly where the lath is placed within the wall, and that the plaster will be brittle with age. Start by using something sharp to gouge out a small hole in the center of the spot for your new receptacle; I use the pointed tip of a drywall saw. Once you've exposed the lath, expand the hole up and down until you find the edges of that piece of lath. The other lath are going to be approximately the same size and spaced up to maybe 1/4" apart. Adjust your planned spot up or down a little so that at least one edge of the box lines up with a gap in the lath -- it's easier to cut through the plaster on its own. Expand the hole until it's big enough for the box, then use a jigsaw to cut away the lath. Vibration from the saw can cause more damage to the wall so take it very slow and easy. (Another reason to avoid the stud: if the lath ends at that stud, you'll only have about 1/2" of it to hold the plaster in place.)
Can a portable air conditioner be used to reduce moisture in a room? I live in a flat in an older house and I have the disadvantage of living next to an outer wall. In autums/springs there is a period when the central heating isn't turned on yet, but it's already getting cold outside. During this time the wall (and generally air inside) gets quite moist and mold starts forming. Also the moist air makes it feel much colder than it really is (the thermometer shows 20C, but it feels like 15C). Thus I'm looking at dehumidifiers and air conditioners. The first are cheaper by half, the latter are more powerful (according to spec) and can also be used for cooling the air in the summer. But I really wonder how much I can trust the spec and how much it would really help. Does anyone have any experience with this?
Can a portable air conditioner be used to reduce moisture in a room? I would consider a dehumidifier which will pull moisture out of the air. I'd also check into why the wall is getting moist. Are you sure there is enough insulation in the wall, because you definitely should not have moisture condensing on or in the walls. An air conditioner will make the room colder which you probably don't want if the weather is already turning cold. The dehumidifier will pull the moisture out of the air without cooling the air the way an air conditioner would. For the time being the dehumidifier should pull moisture out of the room for you. The specs for the appliances (dehumidifier or air conditioner) are usually fairly accurate, most notably on larger name brands. I've found knock-off and smaller brands to be a bit sketchy when it comes to performance, so I've learned my lesson and usually go for the larger more established brand names when it comes to things like this.
Can a portable air conditioner be used to reduce moisture in a room? I live in MN and we recently replaced all of our windows with replacement inserts (Marvin Windows). After talking with several experts (and 4 different companies) they all agree wood is still the best. The issue with Vinyl is/was the brittleness in colder climates. Fiberglass is supposed to help with that but it is relatively new so there is no long-term analysis that can be done. In summary: Fiberglass is supposed to be good but is unproven.
Can a portable air conditioner be used to reduce moisture in a room? A good Do-it-yourself book.
Can a portable air conditioner be used to reduce moisture in a room? I would jack it up with a crowbar or new 2x4. Go to Lowes and get some paver stones to place under there. You may have to dig out a little dirt, but not too much. Make sure the pavers are level.
How hard is it to remove ducts? I have an incredibly toxic smell emanating from one of my floor vents. I think one of my cats peed in the vent. Will I be able to remove the duct-work without ripping out the linoleum and sub-floor? What do I need to do to clean ducts?
How hard is it to remove ducts? The one at my house is new and it appears to be powder-coated. I'd let the gas company fix it though.
What to consider from picking a toolbox? I need a tolbox but have got no experience with one. Can you suggest what things to consider before I choose one? Some examples will be very helpful.
What to consider from picking a toolbox? One of the best ways to keep your hood quiet is to buy something that has adequate CFM ratings for your situation without being overkill. A 900-CFM hood is probably never going to be as quiet as a 600-CFM hood and 600 CFMs is usually overkill for all but the most professional of range tops. Also, if you can find a hood that has infinite fan speed like the Kenmore 50303, then you can select a speed that isn't as loud as High, but provides better ventilation than Low. After you figure out how much CFM you really need, then you can start comparing Sone ratings (which is usually tested and reported on the highest setting). As an additional tip, barrel-shaped centrifugal fans are usually quieter than standard blade fans that chop the air.
What to consider from picking a toolbox? Some aspects you should consider would be: Size: If you're just starting out with your tool collection, you may want to look into a tool set/tool box combo. The one from the link has several drawers with a bigger top compartment. You can also get an expanding tool box which lets you see where all your tools are without having to go through all your drawers. If you just want somewhere to store a limited amount of tools because you don't use them often, I'd suggest a simple plastic toolbox like this one. My first toolbox was a similar design with a lift-out tray and small hardware storage compartments in the lid. It is a bit of a hassle to go digging around in the one main compartment though. Do you have a garage full of tools? A rolling tool chest has a high storage capacity with lots of drawers for easy organization. The one here has a big drawer for larger items and several drawers for organization of smaller tools. An easily portable tool bag would be a great addition if you go this route, since a large chest isn't portable. Portability: Are you going to be working at other locations than where you store your tools? A truck toolbox might be useful if you're always working at different locations. (I just realized I made the assumption that everyone owns a truck - whoops!) However, if you're mostly doing home improvement jobs at your own house, you probably don't need one of these. Work Environment: If you're doing most of your work on your own house, you probably don't need a lockable tool box. However, if you're planning on working in environments where more than close friends have access too, you definitely want to protect your tools from theft. Are you going to be carrying it around, banging it up? Then you probably want a metal toolbox. Otherwise, if it's just going to sit in the garage, a plastic one might be okay. Accessibility: A tool bag or tool bucket organizer is the easiest way to keep tools nearby when you're working (other than a tool belt). I recently purchased a bag with a large center compartment and lots of pockets on the outside. I can see where all my tools are without digging through a toolbox. For home improvement projects, I'd recommend this style. You do have to consider that you can't lock it though.
What to consider from picking a toolbox? Make sure it's not too big for you to be able to move. Even if you're planning on just using it for storage, you will need to move it from time to time. So you'll need to make sure you can still lift it when it's full. Even if it has wheels there will be times you'll need to move it upstairs for example. If you're moving it a lot then choose one that's just big enough to hold the tools you need. That way you won't be tempted to overfill it. You'll also need to ensure that it will fit in your vehicle.
What are the pros and cons of prefab granite vs. custom slab? I am remodeling my kitchen and would like to put in granite countertops. It seems that there are two main ways to get granite. Buy a large slab and have it custom cut to fit the kitchen design. Buy prefabricated slabs that are already cut and polished in 9'x2' sections. The prefabricated route seems significantly cheaper - almost half the cost of the slab route. Still, I wonder what the drawbacks are. My kitchen will have two 90 degree corners, and I'm wondering how these are accomplished with prefab granite. How do they make the corner seams look clean? Also, is it possible to get fancier ogee style edges with prefab? Overall, what are the pros and cons of prefab granite vs slab granite?
Tips and advice for installing a chimney cap? I have an older wood-burning fireplace that is missing a chimney cap. I'd like to install one prior to rain season here in California but would still like the ability to use the fireplace now and then (with the cap on). I was originally thinking that this is a fairly simple DIY project but another post suggested that this can/should be done by a professional. I'm not sure if this was because the other post involved a Gas fireplace or not. I have a couple questions: What information is needed to purchase an appropriately sized chimney cap? I found a checklist here but wasn't sure if more info was needed. Is chimney cap installation widely accepted as a task best left to professionals?
Tips and advice for installing a chimney cap? To answer your question directly, it depends entirely on the type of tree and the type of herbicide. It might be okay, but it might not be. It is possible to kill a tree with herbicides, and it is possible to kill poison ivy on its own with certain herbicides without killing certain trees. Unless you're prepared to be absolutely certain that the type of herbicide you're using isn't going to harm a tree you care about, it's probably a safe bet to skip it. There's nothing that a pick axe + hoe + gloves can't solve. Rip the suckers out!
Tips and advice for installing a chimney cap? Every air conditioner I've ever seen works not only to cool the air but also to pull moisture out of it. That's often why you get dripped on when you walk underneath a window unit. There might be condensation on the cooling coils, but more often than not the "conditioning" of the air includes bringing it down to a comfortable humidity: literally pulling moisture out of the air and draining through a pipe -- often that part of the a/c's job is more important than altering the temperature in terms of comfort. So yes, an a/c will be more expensive than a dehumidifier, but that's because it does both jobs: cooling and reducing moisture in the air. I'd go the double-duty air conditioner route, but then again, I live in Florida and we really can't get enough a/c down here! Also, I've seen dehumidifiers in action and I wasn't impressed. You usually have to manually empty the water collection area, and even then it really doesn't do all that great of a job lowering the humidity.
Tips and advice for installing a chimney cap? I'll defer to the experts, but in the meantime, this link may be helpful in describing the basic pros and cons of the various tub options (scroll down the page to see the pro/con breakdown). From what I could find, the material itself is quite resilient against damage, mold, and color fading. That being said, the largest objection has been personal preference as some people consider cultured marble to look "dated". -M
Why is there no hot water from sink tap unless shower or bath has been run? We have just had a new boiler and new bathroom fitted. Shower and bath work fine - takes a minute or so for water to heat up, its a combi boiler and the boiler is on another floor to bathroom. However the sink tap in bathroom will not get hot unless either a shower or bath has been run. My guess was that the sink tap does not create enough pressure to really get the boiler going, and the pipes need warming up. To clarify the water from sink gets luke warm, at best, with no shower/bath. While if sink tap is run shortly after shower/bath the water is perfectly hot (~60c as expected) Any tips ?
Why do my pipes creak 10 minutes after using them? Our recently installed bathroom uses existing pipes that were previously plumbed into cut out sections of joists, with no cladding. Approximately 10 minutes after use there is a quite loud creaking. We were advised this was because of the absence of cladding, and that quick solution is to use expanding foam in between the pipe and timber joist, to act as cladding. this avoids the much bigger job of completely refitting pipes and pulling up floor/re cutting joists. The pipes are easily accessible at the moment as we are renovating (we have the ceiling off in the room below bathroom, but the bathroom itself is all tiled up). Will this work, any other ideas?
Why do my pipes creak 10 minutes after using them? I don't see why not. The creaking is caused by the pipes rubbing on the joists as they expand and contract when first the pipe heats up as hot water runs through and then cools down as the water left in the pipe cools down. If you wrap the pipes in insulation this will have the dual effect of stopping the creaking and keeping the hot water in the pipes warmer for longer.
How do I eliminate the "whooshing" sound of water running though pipes? At every faucet and toilet in our house, when water is running, it creates a loud wooshing noise in the walls. I'm not sure how else to describe it, but it's like the normal "oh I can hear the sink or toilet on upstairs" but VERY loud. What, if anything, can I do to reduce or completely eliminate the noise?
How do I eliminate the "whooshing" sound of water running though pipes? Some form of insulation, either normal pipe cladding or expanding foam could be used to reduce the noise.
How do I eliminate the "whooshing" sound of water running though pipes? For a typical masonry chimney installing a chimney cap is something you can tackle yourself. However, do not try to fabricate a cap yourself. A chimney cap is not something that you want to make at home. The cap you purchase should come with the proper fasteners which will usually be screws that are pointed on the ends to penetrate the flue liner that is exposed at the very top of your chimney. Some caps have a flue built in that requires a cable to run down the length of the chimney. Unless there is a problem with your fireplace I would not use one like that. The materials used to construct the cap are important. Don't buy one that could rust and consider a finish that will never need repainted. While you are up there take the time to inspect your chimney inside and out. Look for any areas that are missing mortar. Check the inside for shiny black covering or cracks. Make sure there are no missing bricks and the top of the chimney properly sheds water. Any of these issues and I recommend brining in a professional.
How do I eliminate the "whooshing" sound of water running though pipes? We are in process of getting ours capped. One thing that put me off doing it myself is getting up on the roof, this and the fact it wasn't that expensive to get an "expert". However, one unexpected problem we encountered - the "expert" we hired considered capping to be filling with cement and completely cutting off air supply. So if you do hire someone it may be worth your while double checking terminology. Capping/Cowl/Crown are all used and be clear that you intend using it as normal. (If anyones worried, our "expert" was happy to dig out the cement and do as we originally requested/intended. And I'm still not sure what the difference is between a Cap,Cowl or Crown).
How do I eliminate the "whooshing" sound of water running though pipes? Make sure the shutoff valves at your toilet and sink are fully open. Inadvertently leaving them partially closed can cause sounds like you describe. EDIT: Just noticed you said "at every faucet and toilet in our house." I'd still check all your shutoffs just to be sure, but also make sure you check the main shutoff valve for the whole house.
How do I eliminate the "whooshing" sound of water running though pipes? I think you are right. There is a minimum flow rate required before the boiler will actually kick on. I have exactly the same thing with my tankless hot water heater. Aside from getting a separate "point of use" hot water heater for just the sink, The only way I'm aware of to get around it is to turn the water all the way over to hot and on full blast. That usually gets enough flow going to start up the water heater. Once hot water starts coming out, you can adjust the temp a bit (at which point the water heater will probably shut off, and all you have is the hot water left in the pipes).
Questions about Heating/Cooling, ducting Little back story - A while ago, I had a contractor out and in passing complained about how cold my house is in the winter (brick, no real insulation) -- brilliantly, he says "well, yea, your furnace is in the front of the house, and it’s what? 60 feet at least to that addition? No wonder you're not getting any heat back there" ... I'll be damned what a great idea. Earlier this week, I finally had my furnace moved to a far more central location in the house ... actually it's as centered as humanly possible without being in the middle of a walk way. The vents in the middle of the house, of course blasts air, the rear of the house a little more but the front ... not NEARLY as much, you can barely feel it -- this concerned me quite a bit (I was wondering if I had made a mistake). Anyway, last night I turned it on for the first time "let’s see how this baby works" -- it went from 64' to 70 in under 45 minutes (!!!!! <-- me excited). What really confused me is the front of the house was just as warm as the rest. This defies logic. Maybe there's no real answer, but I'm really curious how this works and if I should worry about improving the ducting to the front so the flow is more balanced or just leave it alone?
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? My bathroom walls were a mix of plaster and drywall with various layers of paint, primer, and skim coating. I attempted to skim coat the walls myself to prepare for priming and painting, but I wasn't happy with the results so I hired someone to do it right. The walls are smooth now but not quite flat. For example, if you put a baseboard against one wall the baseboard touches the wall at two high points horizontally and there is space between the rest of the baseboard and wall. The drywall guy said he would come back and fix anything that needs to be done such as those gaps and any other wall imperfections. He said however, that I should prime the walls and finish and nail the baseboards before he fixes the imperfections. He said that many of the subtle nicks and grooves in the wall would stand out better once the primer had been applied. He also said that he could achieve better results if the baseboards were nailed in first rather than using a straight edge to even out the low points, and that he would fill in from the top of the baseboards on up. It seems to me that it would be easier to use a straight edge to even it out and that the baseboards would only get in the way. He said he didn't want to make it flat only to have me put on the baseboards and find out that it still looked off. I don't really buy that. It also seems odd to prime first before getting all the imperfections since the primer seals the wall and putting patches on top of that doesn't seem quite right. I'm not a professional and I don't want to tell him how to do his job, but if he's cutting corners I don't want to be taken advantage of either. Personally I think he should have evened out the low points at the beginning. Hidden nicks I can understand. I'd be grateful for any informed opinions.
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? Our previous house had a whole house fan. I wired it up on a timer switch, so I could have it on when we went to bed, but have it shut off in the middle of the night. This cooled the house when we went to bed, but didn't pull the really cold air in early in the morning. Most of the newer whole house fans are much quieter and energy efficient. Many of them also have insulating doors that automatically close. For more information, watch this video from Ask This Old House.
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? I had to have my walls skim coated and I waited until I was completely done with everything before putting the baseboards on. I didn't want to take any chances scuffing them up or getting paint on them. My vote is do them absolutely last.
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? It's true that primer will show you any imperfections on your wall. When I skim coated my ceilings, I was always surprised to find out how many spots I had missed after I primed. I'd say you should definitely prime first, and afterwards prime the spots your drywall guy skimmed again. As for the baseboards, I'm not completely sure what 'professionals' do, but I would put them on last. It will be much easier to paint your wall if the baseboards haven't been installed. Not having to either tape or carefully cut in will save you quite a bit of time and get you a better end result. Your drywall guy should be able to get the wall straight enough without the baseboards installed. Afterwards, if you still have a gap between the baseboards and wall, you can use caulk to fill it in. (Assuming it's not >1/4")
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? I would put on the baseboards, but only tack them in place so they can easily be removed when the drywall guy is done. The reason he is probably asking you to install them, is so he can make sure you are happy with the finish before he leaves so he doesn't have to come back. It's probably a good idea anyway, because it would be a shame to get all the painting done only to realize the baseboards don't fit right. Then you would have to start all over again.
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? The big difference as you mentioned is price. The seams with the pre-cut pieces should not be an issue (assuming the installers are good at what they do), the more noticeable factor will be the difference in colors and patterns. If the entire counter is cut from a large slab, the colors and patterns will be consistent throughout the entire counter. If the counter is assembled with pre-cut pieces, you may notice differences in colors and patterns from one piece to another. The choice here, however, would come down to preference. Some people might prefer the look of one method over the other, so it's hard to say what you'll like better. I would find out if they have a show room or can provide pictures (from previous jobs) of the different methods, then you can decide which you personally prefer (while keeping your budget in mind).
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? It entirely depends on which herbicides you use. For example, Glyphosate is commonly used in Round-Up and Rodeo products and is not selective on which plant it kills. Triclopyr is another popular one but can also affect wooded plants. If you're very concerned about the tree, you'll likely need to speak to a professional or find another way to extract the ivy.
Should I install baseboards before or after skimcoating? If it works to your satisfaction (that is, if it heats the house properly), then leave it alone. There are a LOT of factors in this, including: length of individual duct runs openings between rooms (door or no door, closed or open if door) sizes of rooms placement of vents in the rooms placement of the return vents I'm no HVAC guy, but I know enough to know that if it's working, DON'T mess with it further.
Fan between rooms? I presently work at home, which means that I spend a lot of time in my office (ya think?). Unfortunately, this room is not a good one for air conditioning (or heating) in the house. I can often get 8 or more degrees of temperature differential between the office and the space outside the office door. Behind the rear wall of my office is a closet that faces a hallway. I was considering running a duct with a fan (something like this) across that closet, so as to exhaust air from my office into the hallway. I normally keep the door (which is at the front of the office) open, so air should flow from the front of the office to the back, out to a different part of the house. Is this a good idea? Is there some big, obvious flaw that I'm missing? Other than the obvious issues of wiring it up properly, is there any control issue that I'm not seeing?
Fan between rooms? The fact that you have this problem even though you keep the office door open indicates that your problem is an insufficient supply of conditioned air to the room, rather than the lack of a return path for the air. This can be caused by the layout and sizing of your ductwork. Before taking on this project, you might try closing off the vent(s) in another room to force more air into your office. If you have a room that stays too cool in summer that would be an ideal candidate. If that works and you want to make the change more permanent, you could install an adjustable damper in that room's duct and set it to a position that keeps that room comfortable but still allows a bit more flow to the office. If that doesn't work out then I think your proposed solution is a good one, possibly the only one short of a major overhaul of your ductwork to get the airflow more balanced. See this question for some tips on installing such a duct.
Is this an acceptable way to add a light to a 3-way circuit? I have three way switches at the top and bottom of my stairs. There is a light at the top of the stairs controlled by the switches and I wish to add a light at the bottom. A 14/2 runs first to the light at the top (hot and neutral from the breaker), then a 14/2 runs to the switch at the top (hot supply and switched hot back to the light), and a 14/3 runs between the switches (travelers and switched return). It would be very difficult to run a new 14/2 (switched hot and neutral) from the light upstairs to the light downstairs, but it is easy to run a 14/2 from the downstairs light to the switch box downstairs. I want to know if it is acceptable to connect the hot switched from the downstairs 3 way to the light and run a separate neutral to the breaker box, or another nearby circuit's neutral. skill level: electrical engineer / homeowner, but not an electrician. (know how to not burn the house down, but don't know the electrical code)
Is this an acceptable way to add a light to a 3-way circuit? I'm in the UK, we got a new recently due to the rebate recently offered on really old boilers. If you get a decent boiler it provides savings because it is more efficient. They are called "condensing" combination boilers - the condensing action reclaims lost heat, I think. We got a Vaillant, who also make the glow-worms. Never heard of Ferroli. And yes we get decent hot water pressure. I would check with a few plumbers/gas engineers, just get a few quotes, and also check the boiler specification for max flow rate. Couple of tips if you do get a new boiler be sure to specify exactly where the pipes go (if you change location), get one of the remote controls (very handy, and allows you to put boiler in loft), and also specify exactly how you want the magnaclean device fitted (collects sludge from central heating). Ours is unfortunately very prominent - we need to move it. Also, we went for a really big powerful boiler, so more than enough water but tbh probably a bit too big for our house: bigger may not necessarily always be better. I'd only get vaillant, glowworm, or worcester-bosch, btw.
Is this an acceptable way to add a light to a 3-way circuit? You're describing a shared neutral, and some local codes allow it, some don't. However, it's usually described with closely related circuits, like a single 12/3 wire feeding alternate receptacles in a kitchen's two 20A circuits. In general, I think they're a bad idea because if circuits A and B share a neutral, you could potentially still have current in A's neutral with A turned off at the service panel. In addition, if A and B are on different phases and there's a problem with the neutral, you could have 240V across all your devices. Using a ganged breaker mitigates those risks somewhat. How difficult would it be to replace the 14/3 between the switches with two 14/2 wires? That would get neutral to the downstairs switch and wouldn't raise any eyebrows come inspection time. If that would also be difficult, next step is to talk to an electrician that knows what's allowed in your area.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? My contractor just installed a Delta Arzo Two Handle Widspread Lavatory 3586LF into a Kohler Persuade Curv top and basin lavatory, K-2956-8. The problem is that the horizontal rod for the popup drain is not long enough to connect to the lifting rod strap. This is because the drain is too far from where the faucet is mounted in the sink. What is the typical solution to this type of problem?
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? EDIT: Niall C. suggested finding a replacement rod that fits. Home depot has a few sizes on-line, but they may have more in the store. I'd try this solution before custom-making one. Depending on the design of the horizontal rod, you may be able to replace it with a length of steel rod with the same diameter. From what I can tell of the parts diagram , you may be able to slide some hardware off of the original rod and back on to your custom cut rod of the same diameter. If the original rod is threaded at one end, you could get a tap and die set or see if threaded rod would work.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? You'll want to run a new 14/2 line from the upstairs light to the downstairs light, that way everything is up to code and is done right.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? I use my Sharp portable AC to dehumidify my man-cave/office fairly often, it works really well - and doesn't require any condensate drains or tank emptying nonsense. Really all the machine is doing is running the AC at a minimum setting to remove the moisture from the air, but this is the most effective method of dehumidifying a room - short of purchasing a dedicated dehumidifier which realigns the airflow path across the condenser and evaporator to give you warm/dry air. Or as a second alternative - buy a pallet of desiccant packs and spread it around the room :) In all seriousness - I actually do something like that in my motorhome (I bought a big desiccant holding "bucket" from West Marine and it does a decent job keeping the dampness out, but you have to replace the pellets and drain the water periodically, so it's kind of messy). Good luck!
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? I agree with baseboard last. The drywall guy can hold a board up to the wall for a straight edge. If the baseboard fit isn't perfect (hardly ever is) when you go to install it, then you can run a bead of calk down the top after you put it on. Then paint the calc either the wall o the baseboard color or split it.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? That is an epic goat rope of a splice job. Completely illegal. In a nutshell - any splice outside of an enclosure is a hack. You can debate the semantics of safety if that's just bonding a ground or whatever but that is crappy work regardless. ALL splices must be in an approved junction box. 2008 NEC®© 300.15 Boxes, Conduit Bodies, or Fittings — Where Required. Where the wiring method is conduit, tubing, Type AC cable, Type MC cable, Type MI cable, nonmetallic-sheathed cable, or other cables, a box or conduit body shall be installed at each conductor splice point, outlet point, switch point, junction point, termination point, or pull point, unless otherwise permitted in 300.15(A) through (M). There is such thing as a "concealable splice" kit (made by AMP) but that is a topic for a separate thread. I'm sure most of you are familiar with the term "code smell" - well this is an electrician's 'code smell'. :)
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? I've learned from dealing with contractors recently that I have to define exactly what I want done so that there is no misunderstanding or room to scale back on the required work. For example, if I want a tree removed I have to describe whether or not I want the roots removed, stump grounded down, etc. You don't want to have to say, "I just assumed you were going to do X, Y, and Z." Consider all of the details you can think of. This can be difficult if you're not familiar with the various approaches and don't know all of the details involved in a job (it's why we hire professionals in the first place), but the more you can research and document the better.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? If he's the lowest bidder, watch out. If he (or she) promises too much, watch out. I agree with the post above that said "Get it in writing". Get changes in writing too. If you make the deal with the Dad and then he drops his son and son in law off to do the work, you might have a problem, although the phrase "Don't make me call your Daddy" is helpful in this case. Money up front is a no-no. As for cars, if a contractor is driving a shiny new Linconln Navigator (think Radon guys), then I think he's ripping me off. I want to see an honest work vehicle, but no junker either.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? I have also heard of putting the suction pipe into the sump (above the water level, where it can draw air) and sealing the sump. Works well if there is drain pipe connected into the sump pump.
What do I do when a horizontal rod for a popup drain is too short? I always try and get 3 or 4 different quotes. You'd be amazed at that difference in price and analysis of the problem/work involved. I have had differences, major differences; one person quoted £1,500, another £6k. The major thing I have learnt is that you have to manage contractors - don't assume anything, every little detail. And get it all written up. And obviously don't pay for time, pay for a job, and of course don't pay until yr happy with the work. If anyone starts quoting a daily rate I run a mile. People have mentioned looking at peoples cars etc I don't think this is useful, who cares what car etc. As logn the work is up to standard and the price is reasonable - I expect a decent worker to make a healthy profit, so why not ? If the work is not up to standard or there a various problems call a stop to the work, I guess you could even include that in your original contract. The other thing I have learnt, try and do things yourself, some of these things are not that hard. Its just having the confidence to do them. Even if you do make a mistake it can normally be rectified.
What kind of glue can be used to join flat drive belt and v-belt? For my special project I need to join flat drive belt with a v-belt (the wider part of it's profile to be precise). Due to the nature of their application such combined part will be rotating with most of the power transfered via the v-belt (it is supposed to be a diy tank track). The joint must be able to bend as the whole contraption will be stretched between two 20cm diameter wheels. I plan to reinforce it with screws or rivets. Could you please advise what kind of glue can do the job?
What kind of glue can be used to join flat drive belt and v-belt? I'd use Shoe Goo ... it dries rubbery and flexible. Another alternative would be contact cemement (I use DAP, personally, do not get the non-flamable one that cleans up with water), but it's much harder to work with in general. And they're serious about using it outside -- the fumes are very strong. And my last choice would be basic rubber cement ... the bond's not great, but if you're reinforcing it, it might be okay. (just don't get the 'repositionable' stuff)
What kind of glue can be used to join flat drive belt and v-belt? I have a cultured marble kitchen sink so I guess my experience is relevant. It is noiseless (unlike a stainless steel one would), looks as cools as a stealth bomber (much cooler that a stainless steel one would), can be washed no-problem. Surely there're drawbacks - I always fear dropping a heavy fryinng pan onto it and crash it this way and obviously I remember to never use any acid-based compounds on it. IMO acid-based compounds can be easily avoided and fear of crashing is mostly subjective - likely something heavy needs to be dropped from a reasonable height to cause real damage. Other than that I don't see any drawbacks so far.
Why is my two way dimmer switch not working? So I am putting in a dimmer switch, replacing a simple single pole switch. It is a simple two way, single pole dimmer, should be pretty easy. The existing switch works fine. AFter installation, the light is always on, turning the dimmer off, and moving the slider up and down, the light is always on. Using a voltmeter, I tested the supply and made sure it was hot. after the switch, the line is always 120v, moving the dimmer and silding it the voltage remains at 120v. This is where is gets even weirder. I removed the dimmer, and tested the conductivity. regardless of the position of the dimmer (off or all the way up), there is not conductivity between the wires (using the beeping mode on the meter). Using the resistive setting on the meter, it also confirms that there is no conductivity regardless of the slider settings. So both of these (light always on and no conductivity) would tell me the dimmer is bad, but they are telling me opposite things. The light always on tell me that the dimmer is shorted and always closed, but the meter measurements tell me that the dimmer is always open. Weird. How is this possible? Regardless, this seems like a bad dimmer and I went back to the old switch until I can pick up a new one. For reference, this is the dimmer: http://www.lutron.com/Products/StandAloneControls/Dimmers-Switches/GlyderDimmer/Pages/Overview.aspx
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? We are refinishing our basement, and are nearing competition. The walls are drywalled, and the ceiling is dropped. There will be about 500 sq ft of finished space, including a full bathroom, and about 300 sq ft of unfinished space. There are two existing vents from the supply heat / AC directly from the main duct supply, that I plan on extending down the few inches into the dropped ceiling tiles. No problem. My question is that there are no cold air return vents pre-cut and should I add one? I can easily add one, but dont know if this is necessary in the basement. Someone told me that since all the duct is exposed (on the unfinished side and above the dropped ceiling) and the furnace is right in the middle of the basement, this would suffice in allow air circulation in the basement. I dont know if I but that argument. If I do add one, I think I should add it at the floor level, not in the ceiling like the supply vents. This way the warm air (for heat) coming from the ceiling would be circulated to the floor for the return. Should I place it at the floor level?
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? Lowe's has a thermal leak detector for $40. I've never used one, so I can't give you an idea of how well they work, but the Amazon rating for this one is 4.5 out of 5 stars.
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? The dimmer switch has some solid-state electronics in the path between the electrical mains and the light that it controls: definitely some form of transistor, and most likely one or more MOSFETs. MOSFETs have very high resistance when they're off, well into the gigaohm range (or higher), and very low resistance when on, in the range of 1 ohm (or lower). Other transistors types have a less extreme swing between on- and off-resistance. The rest of the circuitry in the dimmer is designed to operate on AC mains voltages, so the small DC voltage that your multimeter drives through the dimmer isn't enough to turn on any of the transistors in the conduction path, so you're reading it as being open-circuit.
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? The reason you might not see any conductivity using a volt meter is because it probably uses Triac thyristors, which are designed for AC, instead of variable resistors which work with both. This still doesn't explain why you're having a problem, unless there's something strange about your power source, or perhaps something strange with the lights.
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? If you're going to be rolling a v-belt around two rollers, I don't think you can glue a continuous flat belt to it and have it stick. Unless the flat belt is very flexible along the length of it (which is usually exactly what it's designed NOT to do), you might have a problem with the belts flexing differently. If you glue the belts while flat, they won't curve, and if you glue them curved, they'll want to stay curved. If you get a flat belt and turn it inside out, then you'll be gluing the reinforced tensioning part of the belts together, and it might work. In that case, I'd probably just use contact cement like Joe and Scott say.
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? Here is another alternative that you may want to look into. Microsoft Holm. It is a web site designed to help people monitor and improve energy performance. They have interfaces with some utility companies, and you can buy a device to monitor your usage and send it back to the service. Ir you can enter it manually. Pretty slick.
Should I add a return air vent in a refinished basement? The only way to truly make the seal last is to repair the closet flange. The toilet is probably flexing the flange when you sit down on it and working away at that wax seal every time it shifts. Our condo had a similar problem where the flange was not completely level and so the toilet shifted around ever-so-slightly but would eventually compromise the seal. Using double wax rings or extra thick single ring make it easier to get the seal right (and every time I install a toilet I go with the biggest single ring I can find) but it still will start leaking eventually. Fortunately there are plenty of DIY closet flange replacement kits which make the job fairly simple. Oh and I also highly recommend wearing nitrile gloves while doing that kind of work...
How do I find where mice are entering my house? So the house I just finished remodeling, and am now living in, has a small mouse problem. We have caught a couple of mice, and suspect there may be more. Catching the mice does little good, if more mice are just walking on in. I have walked around the entire house, and have found no voids > 1/4" in diameter. There were a few smaller voids (no larger than 1/8") around entry points for wiring/plumbing, which I filled with expanding foam. My question now is- how do I find where the mice are entering the house? Any tips?
How do I find where mice are entering my house? I'm almost certain any occupied space is required to have a supply and return duct for HVAC. Not quite sure if you can say it's a common plenum in the basement if the furnace is in another room. Also - I've never seen a return in the floor. On the wall and in the ceiling. This is speaking from experience working as an HVAC controls field service engineer in my previous life. Running a return should be easy, you could get some flex ducting and run it above your t-bar ceiling.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? In a large building there is a process that takes place during construction called air balancing where the airflow from each supply and return is measured and adjusted against a spec. Basically you use this big flow hood device and measure the CFM of air through your registers. Air flow to each space is calculated by a mechanical consulting engineer who takes a bunch of factors into consideration regarding the heating, cooling and make up and air change requirements for a particluar space. It's never done in a residential property unless you're talking about a big baller mansion using a commercial HVAC system. Anyhow - the issues you described with the rooms located on long duct runs away from the furnace is a common problem. Moving your furnace was a smart idea considering you really have no other control over how much air is delivered to each room. A residential HVAC control scheme is vastly different because the airflow and heat is on demand - and you have zero control over the volume of air delivered. If you really want to try and tweak the airflow towards your more distant rooms, the only thing you can really do is to block off part of the discharge register(s) closest to the furnace - that will help push air to the most distant parts of the ductwork, at the expense of not delivering as much heating to the other spaces. Also, insulating your ductwork and ensuring all the joints are sealed (taped) will help a ton. All this aside - I don't miss working in the HVAC world one bit.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? I've found that mice can get in almost anywhere. I don't know how your house is setup but I have a tree which is relatively near my roof. I've had mice get up on the tree, climb up and into the roof vent. If I were you I'd just drop some money on a good exterminator (check the Better Business Bureau to find a reputable one) and have them get the house a good once over. As for checking on your own, I'd look for a trail of mouse droppings or urine sprays. Mice don't really have any sort of bladder control and just let go wherever they are and leave droppings everywhere so you might find some near the holes that they frequent. DISCLAIMER: I only say drop the money on a professional because I REALLY have a strong aversion to mice and bugs, especially when they're in my house. I don't mess around when I see one, I go right for the phone and call a pro so my reaction (as well as my response here) is tempered by this aversion. I'm far from an expert on the various vermin that may get into a house, but that would be my recommendation since mice are pretty clever when it comes to squeezing into small spaces.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? Make sure you remove the food source they are eating. Stop giving them a reason to try and get into your house.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? The direct answer to your question is "yes", you have a defective dimmer. You cannot test conductivity on a solid state dimmer with a VOM. Get to the hardware store and your problem will be solved. Good luck.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? Tester is absolutely right. Don't over complicate the job. Put the light fixtures, as many as you want, in a simple parallel circuit from the existing one with 14/2wg/nm and you will be fine and confirm to current code. simple, huh? BTW, adding an extra neutral on a single phase 120vac leg cannot introduce 240vac. impossible.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? I'm a long time general contractor, short time on this site,but I have done and have had done many walls with "Skim Coating".Your drywall contractor is right and wrong. He is right about going ahead and priming the walls. It shows the imperfections and can be easily over mudded or filled with light weight spackle over the primer and reprimed. Keep in mind that skim coating over old drywall is not a plaster job. The skim will follow the existing long gradual bows and dips to some degree and isn't a fix to really bad drywall, especially a stud hugging 3/8's board job. I disagree with putting on the baseboard first. Use a scrap piece of trim or a 1X piece of stock to check for large gaps, and fill them. Trying to fill large gaps after the trim is on will be a mess of mud over the edges of the trim and will reopen as temp and humidity changes. Any gaps less than 1/4 inch can be easily filled with painter's caulk after the trim is installed and touched up with the wall color. The drywall contractor can't make it perfect, so buy a few tubes of Alex Painters Caulk and finish it off real nice after the walls are painted, trim installed, in that order. Good luck.
How do I find where mice are entering my house? Repairing these worn spots should be fairly easy assuming the damage is only to the urethane finish and not into the wood itself. This should be as easy as buffing the affected area with a green dish style scrubby to remove loose finish and slightly level the surrounding surface. If the scrubby is not quite aggressive enough, use some very fine 220 grit sand paper gently by hand or with a DA or vibrating style sander. Without seeing the area and damage, it is hard to say how far you need to sand, but most likely do the area where the chairs have worn the finish to slightly into the non affected area. Be absolutely sure to get the same urethane product and finish (satin, semi gloss, or gloss) to do the overcoat. After cleaning all dust etc after sanding, apply a VERY THIN coat of the new finish. Allow this to dry completely, buff sand the area again removing any dust that dried into wet finish, assuring it is extremely smooth to the touch. Repeat this process with at least 3 coats. I recommend using a good grade foam brush or very good Purdy flared bristle brush. If the area is larger, consider a mohair roller. A mohair roller is simply a very low nap roller avail at a good paint specialty store. You may see a slight difference in the new finish to the old surrounding area, simply because of the age of the rest of the room, however that is a small compromise compared to having the damage migrate into the wood which will require a much more extensive repair later. Good luck
Recommendations for carpet tile installation I have a high-traffic game-room that needs to be re carpeted. I've decided that carpet tile is the way to go because I want to be able to wash or replace individual carpet tiles when they are damaged and/or stained. The game-room is upstairs and the room is currently stripped down to the bare plywood subfloor. The plywood subfloor probably needs to be caulked and primed... it's got fairly wide gaps at the seams (1/4" gaps) and it's got overspray for the paint and wall-texture when the house was constructed. I'm debating whether to go with peel and stick or glue-down... if glue-down, what kind of glue can be easly removed/replace if I need to pull and up and replace a tile. I've heard this is "releasable" glue for glue-down carpet tiles. One concern is how to protect against water damage if a drink is dropped on the floor... is there a good way to seal the floor be water resistant?
Recommendations for carpet tile installation You can make the floor water resistant by varnishing it. Two or three coats should protect it from most damage, especially if you lift the affected tiles straight away. Most damage is done by the prolonged contact of the water with the floor. Are you expecting a lot of spillage? This does mean that you might want to consider not sticking the tiles down or only using a very light adhesive. If the tiles are well fitted and cover all of the floor area there shouldn't be any lateral movement in the tiles themselves.
Can I install a 220V chandelier from Turkey on a Canadian 110V circuit? I got a 70 years old chandelier from Turkey that is wired in 220V. The seller told me that the electric cable has been recently changed and that it will work in 110 or 220V. I'm in Canada where the cabling is all 110V. The wiring of the chandelier is different from here and I was wondering if it's safe to use here... And if so, how to install it? My father is working in the home improvement industry and is able to install anything electric related but I want to make checks before.
Can I install a 220V chandelier from Turkey on a Canadian 110V circuit? There are a few things that would make me nervous about doing this: For a given wattage, bulbs rated for 110 V will draw over twice as much current as those rated for 240 V. For example, 60 W @ 240 V is 250 mA; 60 W @ 110 V is 550 mA. Are the supply wires going to be able to carry enough current for as many bulbs and at the wattage you want? The extra live wire is probably to allow independent control of parts of the chandelier from two light switches, so the limiting factor will be the neutral. In any light fixture that you could buy in the US or Canada, any exposed metal parts that could be energized in a fault would be grounded. Your photos don't show a ground lead -- is there one, and is it hooked up correctly? My advice would be to talk to an antique dealer that specializes in lighting. I imagine that there's a market for importing and/or updating fixtures to current standards, and they would probably be able to put you in touch with someone who could do any work that's required. Installation should be easy once it's ready. US wiring has color coded wires for live and neutral; if Canada is the same, you'd probably need to tag the neutral wire to indicate that it is neutral.
What to look for in buying laminate flooring We are beginning to look at replacing the floors in our home and are considering laminate flooring. We are wondering if there is a difference in type and quality, especially when pricing is concerned. For example, the flooring at Lowe's is considerable more expensive than at Sam's Club; should I be worried that the lower cost flooring is a lesser quality? Are there other considerations besides price?
If my air conditioner return line iced over and the fan stopped, is it broken? We've lived in our house for three summers and have never had any problems with the air conditioner. Today I noticed that there was ice on the coolant return line outside the house. I didn't think anything of it. Later in the day (now), the system had shut off. Even though the temperature in the house was much higher than the thermostat setting, neither the air blower nor the fan in the AC unit outside was running. I've read that the ice on the lines may mean that the system is low on coolant. Will simply having the coolant recharged fix the problem? Do I just need to wait for something to thaw?
If my air conditioner return line iced over and the fan stopped, is it broken? A 220 circuit in a residential application consists of two 110V lines with their AC voltage out of phase with each other. In your breaker panel you can see this as a double breaker with two hot lines going to the same outlet. So each of the two wires in your chandelier marked "electric", back in Turkey, would have been connected to one of the two 110V hot wires. In your house in Canada, you'll use a single wire nut to connect both of those wires to the single black (hot) wire going into your ceiling box. Each of the two separate 110V "circuits" within the fixture will still be being driven by 110V, and you should have no issue with wiring ampacity within the fixture. The overall fixture's current draw on your home wiring will be doubled, but as long as your breaker doesn't trip when you turn on the light you're fine. If it does trip, just switch to lower-wattage bulbs. As Niall C. indicated, do try to locate a ground wire, and if one's not provided use a piece of bare copper wire to connect the metal frame of the fixture to the ground wire in your ceilling box. EDIT: Just noticed Niall's commend about the shared neutral, and he's right, the neutral will be carrying double the current if you use bulbs of rated wattage. I'd recommend halving the rated bulb wattage so you don't overcurrent that neutral wire.
Drought-Resistant Lawn/Turf Recommendation For Area Above Septic We recently had a new septic system installed in the front yard. The installation went fine but the front-yard is quite bare now (almost all dirt). I want to have a nice lawn in front but am paranoid of having to water it too much and creating a problem later (as mentioned in this prior post). I'd like to know if there is a specific type of grass that would be ideal for this type of scenario; something that wouldn't require much water. Any suggestions? Our house is located in Aptos, CA. Here's a brief weather summary: Weather is mild during summer when temperatures tend to be in the 70's and cool during winter when temperatures tend to be in the 40's/50's. The warmest month of the year is September with an average maximum temperature of 75.60 degrees Fahrenheit, while the coldest month of the year is December with an average minimum temperature of 39.60 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperature variations between night and day tend to be moderate during summer with a difference that can reach 22 degrees Fahrenheit, and moderate during winter with an average difference of 21 degrees Fahrenheit. The annual average precipitation at Aptos is 30.67 Inches. Winter months tend to be wetter than summer months. The wettest month of the year is January with an average rainfall of 6.49 Inches.
Drought-Resistant Lawn/Turf Recommendation For Area Above Septic Sorry, I can't help you with the type of grass. But I do have some suggestions that will work with any type. Don't just leave it dirt. Improve the dirt. Add compost to the soil. If necessary, have the compost roto-tilled in. Organic matter helps the soil to retain moisture. Periodically aerate the soil (yearly is a good idea if you can do so. A pull-behind aerator is not that expensive if you have a small tractor, and well worth the expense.) After each aeration, add more compost on the surface. Grass with a deep, robust root system can survive a period of no water for longer than otherwise. You may also find it a good idea to check your soil for problems. Is it heavy clay? Sand? Are there problem trees in the area, like walnut? Is the soil too acidic?
Drought-Resistant Lawn/Turf Recommendation For Area Above Septic Great question! My wife and I were examining laminate flooring a little while ago too. Not all of them are alike -- here are some things to consider. Check the warranty. Cheaper laminate will usually have a shorter warranty with more conditions (e.g. 10 - 15 years only protecting factory defects). More expensive laminate will usually cover more conditions for a longer time (e.g. 25 years+ covering factory defect, normal wear and tear, fading, staining, denting and water resistance). Keep in mind that these are examples -- every manufacturer is different. Find out details of how a sample is made A lot of laminate flooring is now treated with Aluminum Oxide which protects it against scratching and denting. More expensive laminate may have more coatings. If you're expecting heavy foot traffic or have animals with nails, you might want to take it into consideration. For answers to questions like this, you might need to contact the manufacturer directly. Thickness varies Laminate thickness can vary anywhere from 5mm to 12mm. The thicker laminate can feel more stable and supposedly be less likely to have problems with humidity changes. Joint integrity varies Not all laminate flooring interconnects in exactly the same way. Some joint connections can withstand weight and water leaks better than others. Name-brand manufacturers claim to have more experience with this. Be sure to check how the pieces fit together. -M
How to seal small cracks in wood door? We have a solid-core wooden front-door and would like to repaint it as our dog has scratched it many times (ahh the joys of pet ownership). We've sanded down the rough spots on the door but we noticed some hair-line cracks in the groove between the panel and the mullion. The cracks aren't large enough to affect the structural integrity of the door but we're thinking that we'll need to seal it before proceeding with applying the paint. We can't sand it because the crack is in an awkward location on the mullion. What can we use to seal small cracks? Caulk? Wood Epoxy? -M
How to seal small cracks in wood door? Caulk or a paintable frame sealant would work. We've used the latter on our Victorian doors to fill gaps between mouldings the body of the door where the wood has shrunk over the years. Make sure you don't overdo it and smooth down the sealant with a damp cloth or finger straight away. This will push the sealant all the way into the gap.
How to seal small cracks in wood door? Since you're going to be painting it afterward, you don't even need to worry about getting a good color match, just sanding to make the repair undetectable. So, just because it can be sanded once dry, I think a wood epoxy would be best. (I've never tried to sand caulk, but I expect the results wouldn't be great. :) Another option would be a wood putty, but I'm not convinced that it would be strong enough to prevent the crack from widening, if there's more structural damage than you know about.
How long do batteries typically last in electronic deadbolts? I'm considering getting a Schlage Plymouth Keypad for our front-door but was curious how long the 9V battery typically lasts. The web site says "3 year battery life" but I'm... skeptical. =) Has anyone used these types of locks before and if so, do the batteries need to be replaced often? -M
What is the order of tasks when refitting a bathroom? I need to completely refit my bathroom, including the following tasks: Replace an old boiler (involves removing an immersion heater from the first floor, adjusting gas supply and changing pipe work) Strip out and fit new units Fit a shower (there is currently no shower piping - just a tap attachment in the bath) Move a radiator Plaster a damp/rotting wall Tile the floor and walls Install new extractor fan Hang a shower curtain I have no idea which order to tackle the tasks. Should I tile the floor and walls before fitting units? or do you tile around fitted units? Appreciate any advice.
What is the order of tasks when refitting a bathroom? The advantage of tiling first are that you don't have to cut as many tiles - just those at the room corners and around pipes. Certain areas will be easier to tile too. The disadvantage is that you need more tiles. You will also need to make sure that all pipes are in the correct location but not connected. This will mean either having the water turned off or fitting isolation valves (of itself not a bad idea).
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? I just installed a receptacle in my basement and I realized I need to reinstall it someplace else. The leads are inserted into the holes behind the receptacle and I can't get them out! The instructions "push to release" are printed on the back of the receptacle with arrows pointing towards slots next to the holes were the leads go in. I'm not sure what or how to push here. I tried inserting the end of a paper clip, which worked once, but almost accidentally. I can't find anything in that slot that disengages the wire. Clearly it's something easy that I'm overlooking, but what? EDIT: Thanks for all the answers. It took me several days before I got back to this project, but the eyeglass screwdriver was what I had on hand and it worked pretty well. The key for me was to push in the part of the slot closer to the edge (rather than the interior) of the receptacle.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? A small flat-head electrician's screwdriver should do the trick. The release mechanism is spring-loaded, so with the wire in place, pushes it to one side. Angle the screwdriver slightly and you should be able to disengage it.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? I usually use the blade from a utility knife. Is is small and thin, but firm enough to not bend. A slotted screwdriver will work like Niall mentioned, but they are usually too thick to fit in the slot. Perhaps a precision slotted screwdriver from a eyeglasses kit would work too.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? To get the lock mechanism to release you will need to use a small tool (such as a small screw driver as in @Niall C's answer or even a utility knife or eyeglass screw driver as in @mohlsen's answer or my preference is a small diameter wood awl). The first tricky part is finding that tool that will fit in the hole and then be long enough and have enough strength to press the lock release. You will find some tools get too wide before reaching far enough down (such as the eye glass screw driver). Then if you look into the slot you will see a lever that you need to press (and you should be able to tell which way to press based on the angle of the lever but usually it is to the center of receptacle). Use your tool to press that release lever. The second tricky part is to make sure you are not pulling on the wire while trying to press the locking release mechanism. Otherwise you will be fighting with yourself and the lock will not disengage (since it will catch the wire and not let it go). One thing to try is to push the wire into the receptacle and then press the lock release and then gently pull the wire out. The complete instructions: With one hand hold the receptacle with the back facing you (difficult to do if you do not have a lot of wire coming from the box). With your other hand, gently push the wire back into the receptacle to relieve pressure on the release latch. With your third hand take the small screwdriver and press the release latch to disengage the lock. The wire will gently come out.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? If you're painting it, I've found the easiest patching material to use is auto body filler- e.g.- "Bondo." It goes on easy, sands easily, and when painting over it, you see no trace. I use it often when working with MDF- it makes seams, screw holes, etc.. disappear.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? We put a dual flush converter on my parents toilet a year ago. It was pretty crappy (pun intended). The problem we found, was that the half flush didn't always clear everything out, and much of the time you had to double flush the half flush. When we called the manufacturer, they stated that with some old toilets, the converters don't work so well. Luckily HD was willing to take the kit back, so we returned it after a couple of weeks of trying to get it to work. Granted, this was one of the first dual flush conversion kits, and they may be better by now, but YMMV, as it seems to depend both on the kit you get, and the toilet it is going on. As for special considerations for septic- the less water you can use the better, so in theory converting to a dual flush should be of benefit. After our experience with my parents, for our new house (on a septic system as well) I just went with a high efficiency 1.28GPF toilet.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? ice usually means either your air handler isn't pushing enough air across the coil, or your system is out of refrigerant. so first step is to set the cool/off switch to off. then set your fan switch to on. if the air handler fan does not turn on, then you have a problem with your air handler or thermostat. possibly cheap. possibly something you can fix yourself. otherwise, you probably have a problem with refrigerant (which should not deplete, and if it does then you have a leak somewhere) or your compressor. in either case, you should leave your system off to avoid damaging your compressor until someone can come out and look at it.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? I've used something similar on my front door for about 4 years now (4xAA instead of a 9V) and it's great not having to carry keys everywhere. On average, I change the batteries about every 12-18 months. I guess it all depends on how often you use it and how worried you are about getting locked out. Personally I don't bother testing the batteries because mine beeps angrily when they start to get low.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? I used one of these with 4xAA's in an apartment with 6 college students who themselves and friends were coming and doing all day long. It was an older model and lasted about 8 months on average, which seems like pretty good mileage. They are also good about warning you when the batteries are low. Living without keys was great.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? A frozen suction line is generally more indicative of poor evaporator coil airflow rather than being low on charge. Before you jump into checking pressures or troubleshooting the furnace/condenser controls, check to make sure your furnace fan is providing proper airflow, the filter is clean and the coil(s) are clean.
How do I uninstall a receptacle when the wires are stuck? I usually use my "tweaker" screwdriver (I think it's like a 1/8th inch wide flat blade, used for screwing down control wires on small screw terminals - sold at Sears under the Craftsman Pro label - they have a red 'spinner' top) to push those tabs in. They're definitely a PITA to work with and I try to eliminate those things when I get an opportunity. They seem to have a tendency to not grip wires as tightly as I like. I actually had one of those release a neutral for no apparent reason (I think it worked loose over time) which killed my old dishwasher electronics. I like the receptacles from Cooper which have holes for the wires on the sides of the receptacle in back but you tighten down a screw to get the proper "bite" into the wire. Additionally if you don't strip the wire length JUST RIGHT on those crappy push-in types you either have nice exposed wiring right at the back of your outlet or the push connection pops out when you're making the box up. That was what I realized after fixing that magically released neutral in my kitchen.
How do I remove drip marks in flat paint on smooth interior walls? I recently had the walls and ceiling in my home office refinished with a smooth texture. When I was painting the walls, in a couple of the corners, I bumped the roller against the adjacent wall. I didn't notice this until after the paint dried so now I have circular drip marks in a couple of spots. The paint is a flat interior latex. How can I remove these marks without damaging the nice new texture (that I paid a not insignificant amount of money to get)? Tools and supplies I have to hand include: full sheets of sandpaper in various grits, hand sander w/ also with various grits (I think 220 is the finest), Roto-Zip (but without any of the buffing/sanding/polishing accessories). I can be convinced to get other tools or supplies within reason. :)
How do I get the sheen even? I am using Behr eggshell paint, and I have put 2 coat of primer and 2 coats of paint, but the sheen is not even in spots. I'm almost ready to give up and get some flat paint. Is there any trick to getting the sheen even across an entire wall?
How do I get the sheen even? Couple things come to mind: Don't go back to previously painted areas until that area has completely dried. While the paint is drying it will look splotchy and uneven. Walk away, don't touch it, and come back in about 4-6 hours when it has dried. It will then look even. Make sure you are putting enough paint on the wall and don't try and stretch a roller too far between loading it with paint. For example, load up your roller with paint and then put the paint on the wall in a wide "W" shape. Then roll it out in that general area but don't try and push the paint too far on the wall without going back to the paint tray. Let the first coat dry thoroughly before putting a second coat on. If you start putting the second coat on too soon (or come back to an area that started drying but has not dried completely) then you will disturb the first coat and get blotches where the portions of the first coat that began to dry already become pulled up and absorbed by the second coat. Roll out an area and then walk away. Don't keep rolling it out trying to get it perfect. Just put the paint on nice and even with about 4 to 6 passes with the roller (ok maybe I do more like 10 to 12) and then move onto the next area of the wall. Rolling the same area out over and over again just makes the coat of paint very thin and also you can end up pushing any dried areas of paint around the wall.
How do I get the sheen even? How about just using an Extra Fine Sanding Sponge:
How do I get the sheen even? If the painting was recent (within say a month or so), and is still a bit rubbery, you can do a great job using a single-edge razor blade to slice off just the offending drip. Hold the blade almost flat to the wall so it doesn't dig in to the surrounding paint. Then you'll just have that little circle to touch up with a dab from the corner of your brush. This also works for other similar blemishes like roller fuzz or small chunks of latex.
How do I get the sheen even? This is a long shot but check your electrical panel and make sure the circuit breaker for the air conditioner is not tripped. I think the air conditioner unit will be on its own circuit separate from the blower that circulates air throughout your house (at least that is how it is set up in my house). If the air conditioner circuit is tripped, then the AC unit will not go on but still you will be hearing your blower and think everything is working.
Is it a good idea to chisel out the edge of rafters for wires? I am wondering if it is a good idea to chisel out the edge of rafters for wires? We want to floor our garage attic, and there are wires criss-crossing on top of the rafters. Update: These are regular 2x4 rafters. Or isn't that regular
Is it a good idea to chisel out the edge of rafters for wires? The top or bottom edges of a beam are the worst places to cut. It is where the most stress occurs. This is one of the reasons why it is best to run wiring/plumbing through holes in the center of your beams. Will it cause a problem? That is impossible to know, unless we also knew how much of a load you would be adding up there, the dimensions of these beams, etc. While it is very possible there would be no problem, remember that those rafters were put there with no plans for a floor above. The structure may not have been designed to take a load. So if these are 2x4 rafters, on which you will then install a waterbed or a hot tub, expect problems. If you will be just using that floor to store a few light boxes, it probably won't be an issue. If the floor that you add consists of 4x8 sheets of plywood, they will add considerable stiffness to the floor, but they will also add weight. As an alternative, you might consider adding sleepers on top of the rafters, which would allow you to avoid cutting into these members at all. Finally, remember to be very careful in nailing/screwing down the new floor. A nail through an electrical line tends to be bad news.
Is it a good idea to chisel out the edge of rafters for wires? I've had this same problem. I have a bunch of tools that will fit in the release, but a crappy all metal fork is what I used. It fits right in, and I wasn't worried about breaking it unlike my nice tools. Just pick one up at a dollar store.
Is it a good idea to chisel out the edge of rafters for wires? There should be zero difference in the safety between the least and most expensive furnace. The major differences will feature related. Any modern furnace purchased in the US meets the appropriate ASTM, NFPA, et al, specifications. More expensive furnaces will features like: Humidifers, multi zone heating ability, economizer, multiple heat exchangers for additional burner efficiency, VFDs to vary the blower fan speed, more advanced burner ignition systems, improved filtration and some even come with electrostatic precipitators built in to help improve your IAQ (indoor air quality). However, you will not get a "safer" furnace by purchasing a more expensive one. I guess there is one caveat - eliminating a pilot light ignition is safer as you don't have to worry about the light blowing out and having that gas leaking, but I don't think anyone is building pilot light furnaces anymore (don't quote me on that). So if there's any recommendation I can make - buy one sans pilot light. And just like any other consumer product - a lot of times you will pay a big premium to purchase products from a marketing company which has an HVAC division... (if you catch my drift) Make sure to get at least 3 estimates to replace that furnace from reputable mechanical contractors (not big box store resellers who just farm out work to a mechanical contractor).
Is it a good idea to chisel out the edge of rafters for wires? From what I heard, Milgard is higher up in the food chain then JeldWen. If they were cars, JeldWen would be Ford, and Milgard would be Benz. Also, they both have different lines of products with varying costs/features. So top-of-the line JeldWen window might be comparable in price/features to a mid-range Milgard. (In the case of JeldWen, their lines are actually different companies that JeldWen bought up over the years, so they can be a lot different quality-wise).
How do I remove glued-on carpet? I'm trying to remove carpet from a small closet in our bathroom (at most 3.5 ft by 3.5 ft). I started to remove it and it looks to have been glued around the perimeter. What's the easiest way to remove it? I recently bought a oscillating multi-tool so I'm wondering if that would work to loosen up the edges. -M UPDATE: I lucked out -- only part of the carpet was glued... the rest was actually nailed in and came up easy. That being said, as a future homeowner, I'd like to hear suggestions for how to tackle this type of issue in the future.
How can I remove superficial pet urine stains from subfloor? After removing the carpet from our bathroom closet, I found urine stains on the plywood sub-floor (serenity now). It sounds bad but the floors are quite sturdy so I'm reasonably certain that it's a superficial stain. What would be the recommended way of cleaning it (short of removing/replacing the sub-floor). I'm planning to eventually place carpeting back in the closet so I'm not concerned with leaving a mark. Just want to make sure it's sanitary and odor-free. -M
How can I remove superficial pet urine stains from subfloor? First, cut away the non-glued part with a craft knife or carpet knife. Next, pull individual strands of the pile away from the mesh using a pliers. Optionally, sand down the remaining bits of the carpet using your multi-tool. Finally (and also optionally), patch any damage to the plywood subfloor with wood filler. The last two steps are optional because it's in a small closet where nobody's going to notice any slight unevenness in the floor.
How can I remove superficial pet urine stains from subfloor? I use Zep pet spotter, but it's intended for carpets, not wood. I think mop it with a dilute solution of chlorine bleach to sanitize the area, then seal it with a primer / sealer to prevent any residual odors from escaping.
Should a bathroom fan vent to a separate duct system? Is it acceptable to route a bathroom exhaust fan to the return of a central air system? I'm afraid this will cause mold to grow in the air return ducts. There is currently a fan in our bathroom and I can't seem to find any separate outlet or vent for it, so I assume that it must be connected our central air system somehow. What is the best practice for routing bathroom fans if mold is a concern?
Should a bathroom fan vent to a separate duct system? A bathroom exhaust fan should vent directly outside with its own dedicated duct, for exactly the reasons you are stating.
Should a bathroom fan vent to a separate duct system? I just love Nok Out. I successfully removed cat urine odors from furniture, matresses and laminated flooring with it.
Should a bathroom fan vent to a separate duct system? What you want to look for are cleaners that are enzyme cleaners. These products actually break down the urine/biological waste. One example (that I use quite often) is Nature's Miracle.
Should I drill a large hole through a double paned window? I have a laundry room in the basement. There is no exhaust vent for the dryer. Currently we just open the window when drying, but this is not the greatest solution. There is a window and it is double paned glass. It seems to me this is probably the easiest option. I am afraid of damaging the window of course. Should I try drilling/cutting the hole in the window for the dryer vent? Or should I have a professional do it? The other option would be to drill a vent hole in the foundation. The window itself is "European Style" in that it has a hinge on one side to be opened inwards and can also be "tipped" inwards. FYI- I am in Europe and they do not use a lumber flooring system(here it is all concrete + cinder blocks), otherwise I would just go up and through the floor joists the old fashioned way. ;-)
How do I level an unlevel floor? The second floor of my house is not to level. The walls are, everything is straight but the floor has a slight pitch. I'm about to remove the current glued vinyl tiles and replace it with a regular vinyl flooring and I want to know if I can correct this.
How do I level an unlevel floor? I had some low pile carpet that was glued down to the subfloor in an addition of my house -- it was one of the first things I took out. (although, I didn't get around to re-laying floor 'til some time after ... but the carpet was so nasty, it had to go, as it was near a not-quite secured door, and a bird managed to get in there and die) I ended up cutting the carpet into managable strips (about 2-3 feet wide), then getting under it with something similar to a garden edger. (but it had a flat blade, not curved ... looks more like this 'scraper') I'm not sure what the tool was sold as ... I was storing my step-dad's gardening and other tools while he was stationed overseas. It came up fairly easily, but there were globs of glue that I did some further scraping / belt sander / etc before laying new flooring (a bamboo floating floor)
How do I level an unlevel floor? NO!!! The vent will expand and contract and break the glass. You need to go through the cinder blocks (preferable, but if you must, go through the concrete). Also, with double paned glass, there is usually an inert gas (or Nitrogen) sealed in between the panes. Drilling it will break the seal. My advice: Get someone to do it for you. It is unlikely you have the drill/bit combination required for the job. It's cheaper to pay someone than to buy the tools.
How do I level an unlevel floor? I would agree with csmba that the Cree LR6 lights are great. I put 8 of them in my living room a few weeks ago (no ceiling lighting before, just a couple of floor lamps.) Great lighting. The LR6's have mulitple colors of LED with a microcontroller that keeps the light the appropriate color (2700K in my case). Highly recommended.
How do I level an unlevel floor? Plugging air leaks in you home is a bit like sticking fingers into a leaking dyke. Plug one hole and another one breaks through. Generally, the situation should have improved with new windows and doors (if installed properly). The technician doing the post-audit should have identified where the air was coming from so you could fix that too. One possibility is that a fire place flue or external fresh air duct to your funrnace was open during the blower test. This would have let a huge amount of air in. Other things to look for are stuck flapper valves in bathroom and kitchen vents. Another place to check and seal would be around the sill plate. Often there are a number of small air leaks here. Individually they are not large but in sum they can amount to a significant air leak.
How do I level an unlevel floor? Let me echo everything that Chris just said so well. Especially the part about NO!!! Drilling a hole through a double pane window will reduce the efficiency of the window. It will almost surely crack when you tried to drill it, if not, then later. And you surely do not have the tools or the skills to drill such a hole. On top of that you do NOT want to breath in any glass dust from drilling that hole. Silicosis is a nasty way to die. An alternative is to take out the window completely. Replace it with glass block, mortared in place, with a hole made the proper size for a vent. Or create a hole through the wall next to the window for your vent.
How do I level an unlevel floor? Depending on how un-level, and the sub-floor material/condition, one option would be to use self-leveling compound. You pour it over the entire floor, it "finds" level (it has a viscosity that allows it to flow until it begins to harden) and let it set up. And Voila! level subfloor.
How do I level an unlevel floor? First - stop running the dryer without a vent immediately. Lint is extrememely flamable. I would look a replacing the window with part wood and part glass, similiar to what woodchips suggests.
How do I level an unlevel floor? I would try oxygen bleach, in particular Stainsolver - see stainsolver.com. I'm not selling it, and in no way associated with it other than being a happy customer.
How do I level an unlevel floor? Look at the picture above. See how the beam curves? This means the upper edge of the beam is (under load) shorter than the bottom edge. In other words, the upper portion of the beam is being compressed, and the lower edge is under tension. This means, that somewhere in the middle of the beam, there is a portion that is not under compression or tension. This is known as the "Neutral Axis" - X on the image - It is not being stressed at all. Most of the forces on the beam occur at the outer edges, and are zero in the middle. This is why we make I-beams -- We can remove some of the material that isn't doing anything for us and make the beam lighter. For a symmetrical beam, the neutral axis is dead center, and that is where you should drill. In theory, a small hole through the neutral axis will have no effect on the load bearing capacity. In practice it will, but it will be minimal. However, chipping out wood on either of the edges, is the worst place to remove material. Image from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_axis
How do I level an unlevel floor? Best caulk gun is at Sherwin Williams. I have no idea why Home Deopot or Lowes does not sell them. It is plastic, not the metal blue or orange ones you get. It is yellow and black. I know I sound crazy, but it makes all the difference in the world. Keep your hands clean. Once caulk gets on your fingers and starts drying you are going to have a mess. keep your hands clean. My take on all those gizmos to use instead of your finger is they end up being more of a pain because they are harder to clean than your finger. Cut the tube at the top for a small hole. Start small, if it's to small, cut a little bigger. Once you cut it too big you will have caulk flowing all over the place, and theres no fixing it. Caulking is no fun, best of luck
What is your best wire management solution for an entertainment system and a home office? What gadgets or devices have you used to help manage wires or cords at home for the entertainment system are and for the home office?
What is your best wire management solution for an entertainment system and a home office? For home office I am a big fan of the Ikea Signum. It is a wire basket, with hooks for wires that attaches and hangs under a desk. What I have done is zip-tie a power strip to the underside of the basket, and route all of the wires up into the basket, then route as much wire as I need up to items on the desk (computer, monitor, printer, etc..). It works quite well, and takes care of the wire mess. I also use zip-ties liberally to bundle wires. For a home entertainment system, I have had good luck with routing wires down the back, and using zip-ties.
How Is "Super Laminate" flooring installed? I recently learned about AABSO "Super Laminate" flooring (aka Vinyl flooring planks). It seems to have some advantages over standard laminate flooring when it comes to moisture resistance so I'm considering it (especially for our kitchen). For some reason, I haven't been able to find installation instructions for it. Can someone summarize the procedure? Is it the same tongue-and-groove implementation as standard laminate? Or completely different? -M
How Is "Super Laminate" flooring installed? It's by no means an all-in-one solution but I've personally found Velcro Cable Ties to be INVALUABLE. You can reuse them over and over; great for those "oh darn!" moments when you need to remove or replace a cable. -M
Is it necessary to sand before the last coat of oil paint? When I'm painting high-gloss oil-based on woodwork (architraves, skirtingboards, windows), I have been following the tin's advice and sanding between all coats. I don't resent sanding after the undercoat/primer because it helps provide a smooth finish, but the final sand often takes the paint off sharp edges, even when I am careful, which can leave them a bit dark after the final coat. Is this final sand necessary?
Is it necessary to sand before the last coat of oil paint? It depends ;) I don't tend to do a final sand for the very reason you mention. However there have been times when the finish hasn't been to my liking so I have sanded - but in these cases I use the finest grade paper and sand very lightly to just take off the drips and/or dust flecks that have settled on the wood. So if the penultimate coat is good you might be OK without sanding, but sanding does provide something for the final coat to bind to if the previous coat was applied some time ago, so ultimately it will provide a more durable finish. If you are painting the second coat as soon as the first coat is dry then you don't need to bother.
Is it necessary to sand before the last coat of oil paint? IMO it's not worth it. Sanding has two primary goals. First of all, it compensates for the surface defects. In case of woodwork it also removes the wood fibers that get raised from the surface when applying paint and are fixed still in the paint layer and thus make the surface less even. Since this is not the first layer of paint you have likely compensated for all the defects and you've surely sanded away all raised wood fibers, so you will likely not get any real benefits from sanding. From my experience - I've coated wood table with two layers of oil-based lacquer. Sanding made huge difference for the first layer, but after I applied the second layer the surface was as even as before the second layer. Definitely I wouldn't sand the second layer if I wanted to apply the third one.
How do I build shelves on non-square (>90 degrees) walls? I want to build shelves into an alcove, but the corners are not square. What is the best approach to this?
How do I achieve required torque when using an impact driver? There's such tool called impact driver (like this one for example). The manual says it uses a special mechanism to produce a series of torque impulses to fasten/loosen nuts and screws. The tool has only two adjustments - the forward/reverse switch and the On/Off switch. The deeper the On/Off switch is pressed the faster the tool motor rotates. There's no clutch to adjust the torque value after which the clutch would disconnect the motor. How do I control the torque without a clutch? Suppose I need to assemble a section of fence that will require say one thousand screw/nut connections with nuts of the same size (that's not an imaginary task - I did such job without an impact driver). Obviosly I need to tighten all nuts to more or less the same torque. If I overtighten a nut it can just break or cut the screw or bend the parts it connects - that's bad. If I undertighten a nut it will soon loosen and fall out - that;s bad as well. So let's pretend I use nuts that need to be tightened to approximately 70 Newton-meters and the driver I use is said to produce torque up to 100 Newton-meters. And of course I need to drive those nuts fast - otherwise why would I use a power tool instead of a screwdriver and a usual wrench? So obviously I can't time the periods of applying torque or count impacts or whatever else - I need some reliable way to achieve more or less the same right torque for all nuts. Please note: I don't care of achieving exactly the right torque. I only care of achieving more or less the required torque - so that the nuts don't loosen on themselves and parts are not damaged while the nuts are being tightened. The primary concern is that the driver works very fast, so if I hold the switch pressed for just too long I can easily overtighten the nut and cause unintended damage. How do I achieve roughly the same torque repeatedly for multiple nuts when using an impact driver?
How do I achieve required torque when using an impact driver? "Not square" can mean two different things: not a right-angle, or rounded. If the walls are not at right angles, you can use a T-bevel to measure the angle between the walls. If you don't have a T-bevel, you can hold a piece of light cardboard against one wall and fold it so the crease is against the other, which you can use as a template for cutting the shelves. If the corners are rounded, I'd use the cardboard again: estimate the radius of the corner, cut a quarter-circle of that radius, and check how well it fits into the corner. If necessary, adjust the estimate and repeat. Then use the quarter-circle as the template.
How do I achieve required torque when using an impact driver? I would get all the bolts driven, quickly, but not tightly using the torque driver. Don't cinch them down. Then walk along and use a hand held torque wrench on each.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? I saw some DIY tutorials recommending to use tileboard to make a cheap whiteboard. I had a piece lying around, and tried some dry-erase markers on it. Turns out they don't erase well at all when dry, and I had to use a window cleaning spray to get it off completely. Do you know of another cheap material that would allow to more easily clean those dry-erase markers off ? Edit : I intend to make it large, so the lighter, the better !
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? I don't know how large of a whiteboard you're looking for but I've used glass. I've used white acrylic paint on the back of the glass to give it a background and it's worked great!! I'd call around to some glass stores and see what a piece will run you. I've also used showerboard (tileboard) and it works fine as well and is available pretty cheaply from a local home improvement store.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? In a previous job, I had a flexible whiteboard at my desk; it came in a roll and attached to the walls with velcro tape. It was only 3'x4' though, so might not be big enough for you. A quick search for "flexible whiteboard" showed this near the top, which might work for you.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? There is also white board paint, that you can use on a variety of surfaces. Here is one example. You can use this directly on walls, or on a board if you need portability. There is also blackboard paint for use with chalk.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? "How do I achieve the same torque repeatedly for multiple nuts when using an impact driver?" Short of manually using a torque wrench like woodchips recommends, you don't. The point of an impact driver is not to apply a consistent torque. It is to apply more torque than can be obtained from a traditional driver. One of the more common uses is to loosen seized up, or over-tightened bolts/screws. I also use mine quite a bit when driving screws into wood when the final torque doesn't matter (e.g.- I just need the screw head to be slightly below the surface of the wood.. rough work). In other words, if your need is consistent torque, an impact driver is not the tool for the job. A traditional clutched driver is going to be more appropriate.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? I have done a little more research regarding this topic. Apparently, a lot of people have this problem. The most recommended solution I have found is to apply metal duct tape around the opening for the gas line. That is where the air is blowing through on my fireplace. I have applied this fix, but I need to wait for winter to see if it helps. The metal duct tape helped somewhat, but I would still have temperatures in the mid 40sF on the lower grate of the fireplace when it was in the 20's outside. I recently discovered the insulation underneath was not sufficient. I could get to that and added additional information. The temperature on the lower grate is now in the 50s when it is in the 20s outside. Obviously, this still need improving, but I am not sure what else I can do without tearing out walls.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? WhiteyBoard cheap whiteboard stickers that are cheap and come in a variety of sizes. Write up about them on LifeHacker: Whiteyboard was started by Jason Wilk, a principal with venture capital firm Y Combinator, after he discovered how much a whiteboard cost at an office supply store. Determined to give small startups an alternative, he came upon the idea of stick-on whiteboards. You can order them in three sizes, starting at 12 by 18 inches for $US10 and ranging up to four by six feet for $US30, and they can be cut to fit whatever size and shape needs you have. Helpful stuff for those with great ideas, but not $US300 and an afternoon to spend buying and installing the sketch space for them.
Which material should I use for a whiteboard that would erase easily? Usually, around the home anyway, there are other signs to let you know when you've applied enough torque. MarkD noted a common one -- when you see the screw head just go below the surface of the wood. In your fencing example, if you're tightening lag screws or nuts with washers, you'll see the washer start to sink into the wood long before you've applied enough torque to shear off or strip the screw or bolt. It's a great tool for this kind of work, and it's super fast. Don't slow yourself down unnecessarily by underestimating your own ability to judge how much torque you've applied, and how much is enough for your application.
Should I put caulk/silicone at base of toilet on hardwood floors? When installing a toilet in a bathroom with hardwood floors, should I put a bead of silicone or caulk around the base to finish things up? Is this necessary, or is it merely aesthetics? I have heard that I should put silicone down, but not caulk. I'm not sure if this is true or not, or how it's determined.
